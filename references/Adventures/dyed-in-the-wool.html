    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">83 - Dyed in the Wool</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I tug--hm. Eravahk make your leash visible and convenient again.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Bounce head up high didn't realize how heavy that was!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Unf coming leash pulling sexy yes Princess.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Hey this trophy is rattling.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">With her by my side I look at it. It's made of silver metal and black stone, beautifully kinky as one woud expect.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Shake it for me. Where's it coming from?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Shake rattle where are you turn sideways on front next it's in here look Princess!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">On the back like a little nubbly thing turns out to be the handle of a panel underneath.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I reach for it and--<i>slipslipslipslip. </i>I'm not surprised, I just the the safety of this for a minute. <i>Slipslipslipslip.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Smooth like glass warm with L--with <i>Boobsong's </i>love hehe I love that name. This is really sexy, game. If I do it long enough will I cum, or need to?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: it can make me horny enough to need Boobsong just because I'm turned on by it, but there is something special that happens if I slip long enough, and it's a reward, a big one.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Dammit now I'm all curious. Are we talking like minutes or hours here?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: not knowing is part of the fun of it. I'll know when it's coming because I'll start feeling sexy warmth that makes me want to play with things I can't because the game slips me when I try.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: Nakedness has a reward like that too. I just have to stay bare of anything other than jewelry long enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Gooey shoes now I'm curious. So much on my mind though. Open the panel."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Pinch knob. Turns? Nope just keep pulling raaah sticky moving THERE.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">What is that that looks beautiful but why was it here like this?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A necklace of black pearls with rainbow-sheening reflections is coiled in the compartment.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Still not sure how this works entirely, can I reach for it? <i>Slip</i>. Nope. Nothing happens at all.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Pick it out for me."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Pick up the oooh in a line not a circle bwahaha anal beads of course it's in back of the trophy!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Each one is bigger than the last--I'm not sure if these'll be more fun used <i>on </i>me or <i>by </i>me! Just my style, too.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Cool! Why's it in there, though? Is there like a note or anything?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">See in the pocket looks like just them wait there's writing!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess look see this writing?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">On the inside of the stamped-metal door of the compartment--is a note from Mama. I'd know that green cursive anywhere:</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">Boobsqueeze I'm so proud of you! Lucy Starlight has some discipline to get into this game, say nothing of win it! Rainbow beads are here to remind you how each step takes the stretch the last one gave to be possible. You can fit that last one easily if you start at the small end, but try the other way and watch how it hurts! You went the whole way up this to get this trophy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay, if the game is really kind I can hold stuff because it's sentimental. I grab the beads and hold them to my chest a moment--no don't let go cocksleeve you earned these too.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Oh Mama. What happened to us?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I press the beads into--into Boobsong's hands.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Put those away and close it up and set that aside. This isn't over, see me?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Lift up high to make tall tower and lower it into the pocket. Close the door push latch raah. Sticky handle hard to use! Trophy onto deck in front of us. Ready Princess I see more visions like the one we were just going to yes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Visions are pressing me so hard I can barely see, everything feels dim...these are different. Dangerous, they could actually rip me out of the Four Dreams and back to whatever hellish life that apartment was part of--that place was where things went truly wrong, and though we've just patched the big tear the fabric is still unravelling from a lifetime worth of consequences of my <i>not </i>knowing what I just told myself. I can't just gleefully waltz in and fix things or nuke them now, this is different, we're in a darker, uglier phase of the journey. I needed the courage and strength, and knowing of Boobsong and her silly sweetness I've been accumulating the whole to get through this, because this next part is going to be <i>brutal </i>and we may not actually survive this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Boobsong is with me, though, and we her I can face anything.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">No, TOO COMPLICATED, ARGH!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's as simple as this: an entire life together on Earth into who even knows what decade we had together exists, full of precious good times if the memories we just saw and this trophy mean anything, a life that's at least not all bad, and in which we were together and I was Lucy Starlight and she was <i>Boobsong </i>and we did stuff like win kinky Olympics together.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's just one problem: deep in the furthest part of my heart I can <i>feel</i> that we left Earth when I was <i>actually </i>fifteen, and that everything hinges on that, the world ending in 1995 and not whenever we think it did now, without it our entire existence unravels. What I've been going through is a compromise of some kind, or...something. It's been wonderful! But, let the life we're looking at in the form of this trophy stand, and everything else unravels. Sacrifice it, if that's even possible, to leave at the right time, and how real is the goodness of the Dreams or any of this?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Dreams how the hell do we fix this?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They show a trail of puddles, reflecting rainbow. They seem like a trail of blood from someone wounded but either that's wrong or the wounded is a unicorn bleeding rainbow blood--oh or a Starlight Princess, huh. I FUCKING NOTICED DREAMS I DEFINITELY DON'T FEEL OKAY RIGHT NOW! "</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Boobsong what the fuck, insight, this is another one for you I think."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I think that says you're wounded and you don't see clear because you lost so much self, Princess."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Yeah, and even though I feel healed it's getting <i>worse--</i>but&nbsp;I know what the problem is! The more we fix things, the more the thing I used to target destroying Earth the second time goes away. We keep helping people be with their seedlings, that's been our whole life at least publicly, and they lose their door because their door came from that moment I died in because that's how we got there. Including our own door. We've been undoing my even being here this whole time. How the fuck do we fix <i>that</i>? That's why I feel like this is all a dream I'm about to wake up from right now, right Dreams? How the fuck do we stop this? These visions are dangerous it's not like before they can <i>get </i>me now because we just fixed the past and now my being here doesn't make sense I'm still on Earth because I'll never have the moment of losing you we used to get me out now. All of this is all like a bubble about to pop. Help, Dreams! Don't drop me!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The sub from my unfinished game Atlantis, which was about treasurehunting the ruins of Atlantis while fighting sea-life that'd been mutated by the dark magics that destroyed Atlantis. It's floating on the surface, ready to dive.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">So the only way out is through. I do want the treasures if this and the memories it came with are an example, but not at the cost of being thrown back to <i>any </i>life on Earth!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show sliced green tomoates.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"That's you, seer, if you can figure it out."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Those look toxic still Princess. You need to fry green tomatos to be able to eat them. It means these things are poisoning you and we should fry them so you can eat them instead. Come on, aren't you super mad about this? Let's burn something! Dreams tell Princess what she can burn next!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now a pufferfish. Same idea. Prepare the food <i>exactly right</i>&nbsp;or die. That's the problem, yes, I do get the metaphor that though the visions pushing on me now feel like they'll kill me there's something good in there if we do this right, like the trophy. How is that an answer to Boobsong's question, Dreams?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Smurf house in a mushroom with Papa smurf outside. That's <i>definitely </i>you, Boobsong.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess he's waiting by his mailbox, see? There's a message you haven't gotten yet. Aren't the Dreams nice, Princess? They answer your question when you ask one, so the pufferfish is what you can burn next, so maybe it means these journies are safe still and it's not like making sushi that's poison if you cut it wrong?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">As soon as she's done talking the dreams show me--C-3P0? For some reason his blurting "<i>oh no, I've been shot!"</i>&nbsp; after Chewie powers him back up hours later in Empire Strikes Back comes to mind--<i>oh</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Tears that hurt too much to cry choke me and my breath shakes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now they show me one of the delicate, fiddly plugs you get inside electronic stuff, meant to be plugged in once when it's built and left forever, but you can fit them back together good as new if you're careful and very gentle and know which way they go.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Weeping of an emotion I don't understand, I know that plug is me being carefully fit back together, I pull Boobsong into my lap--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Jump on you raah HUG YOU RRRRRR!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--so she's wrapped around me again.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's like when I found I couldn't tell the Five Pointed Star to my priestess, strange peace, a trust I didn't think my soul could do that feels as alien and wonderful as the purple of Boobsong's eyes that isn't a Wavelength but that my human eyes let me see.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Here is where the panic of being so fragile should come in, or bitterness of being killed, or some such screaming should be, but there's not, just the tears that keep coming flowing raw emotion out of me like I'm saying <i>I'm still not okay please--</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams interrupt to show me the giant fireplace from Camp Monomonac that's in the camp's living room now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Seer, that's for you."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I think it means to be small and let them take care of you."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh. Because we were like 8 when we went there with the family. Okay then they can figure out what to do with the sad little girl who can't do anything but sit there and hug her doll and cry because that's all I <i>can </i>do.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A vision comes clear out of the mess: the newspaper table in the living room in Stamford, where we piled up the week's newspapers to page through for interesting stuff. Somehow, like the way you know stuff in dreams, I know this has to do with my dad's homophobia. He wouldn't call it that, and he was a long way from the kind of hate that's on the news all the time, but he did think it was a disease if not a choice. That was when the Episcopal church was starting to think about gay marriage, so he talked about it constantly. It never made me feel good even when I thought he knew what he was talking about. Now...no wonder it cut. It was bad twice! One more reason for me to see the world as the straight son he wanted and lesbian daughter he didn't. It hurt because I took his opinions on things so seriously.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Game, Dreams--which of you should I even be turning to?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: turn to the Dreams. My game is for fun, but it's been helping me get here where the Dreams can help me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Dreams fix it ouch.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Seahorse, bagpiper, pressure points on a foot, hand dryer that uses a super-powerful and narrow stream of air to wipe water away.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They pick me into a journey of being in a wine vinyard and I realize the visions were instructions. Male seahorses carry the pregnancy, the bagpiper is wearing a "skirt" in a masculine way, this is telling me where to apply pressure with my words (because my breath to say them as air in the dryer).</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">But I <i>like</i> feeling feminine because I feel kind of pregnant with hehe Boobsong (I'm starting to see why I named her that)!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now why the fuck am I in a wine vinyard? This will be something wtih Picard, won't it--there's Geordi with his bionic eyes instead of VISOR. I'm in a vinyard because All Good Things--must come to an end.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay so I'm here to wipe away the pressure to see my femme style and carrying Boobsong as masculine things. So--ugh! I'm dressed up in boy clothes, and not even nice ones! Double ugh, another journey where I'm stuck in a boy's body. The outfit is familiar, I know this gross old jacket, but spike all of this. I start stripping immediately, ignoring Geordi, he's just here to remind me what episode this is.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Lilac cumbottles yes all good things must come to an end, like the son you thought you had, dad. Nothing personal but this is going away now. Have fun being forced to try your thoughts about homosexuality on an up close and personal test case.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm naked <i>fast</i>, but there's nothing interesting around, just the vinyard. Pressure points on feet to wipe away misgendering--HAH. Silly Dreams. This is just imagination. I stomp my bare foot as hard as I can--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I'm a GIRL!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--and decide the bounce of it will bounce my right body out of where it was hiding to fix this one.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Much better. Boobsong--I hold my hand in the air and suddenly it's on top of her head.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Also I'm totally gay!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Haaah breastgrab kiss tongue oh <b>Princess </b>tongue across space from your lips to my lips kiss hhaah</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I lift my head from Boobsong's to glare around. "SEE!?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Suddenly we're back in Stamford <i>watching </i>All Good Things the first time when I was 13. The scene I was just in is on, and my dad...looks like he's seen a ghost...sparkler cakes and boobjello Dreams did you just journey me to <i>the episode of TNG on our TV?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They show me a view looking down through the Strawberry Dynasty's open timegate.&nbsp;We used the TNG Episode All Good Things as a timegate to access 1993 and give my dad some very important information.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Well, I hope he and all that waterlogged bubbletape he keeps spouting about the secret reasons gay people are gay and why all their relationships are doomed forever got something to think about.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now back to the whaleship--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--my dad, standing in full vestments in the middle of the aisle at Saint John's giving a sermon about how from seeing Geordi without his VISOR but with normal-seeming eyes (he's purposefully ignoring that a close look showed them to be bionic somehow, and this isn't at all the first time he's used Trek as a framework for a sermon) he realized that though Geordi's blindness was a disease, in the world he lived in he could make from it something that let him literally see what no-one else could and though the Geordi in All Good Things seemed to be whole where the other hadn't been he was in some way lessened anyway, and that if that a world could be imagined where that could be true of something so unambiguously negative as blindness, couldn't we now imagine that we'd entered a world where things like homosexuality and transgenderism were the same and let those who "bore" them see what no-one else could before, and thereby be seen as blessings? He's done a complete about-face on this--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--my bike parked against the stone wall by the garage but <i>my bike </i>is this pink girl's bike with a basket--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--I'm riding it down the driveway and can see my outfit, pink overalls with a tight white long-sleeve shirt so stereotypical and yet this is how I would trans kid yes<i>&nbsp;</i>wait oh god this stuff means my parents were Supporting Me that's kind of a scary thought they always turned it up to eleventy billion in anything! I'm getting the mail, this is a big mailbox oh yeah because I'm 13, this is so totally me finding a use for my bike's basket--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--Lyra (as I called her before we were old enough for <i>Boobsong</i>) coming into my room with laundry basket and starting to put clothes away in my dresser, they're bright and girly looking instead of my old T-shirts and jeans, ooh dresses! She's folding them carefully before putting them away--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--Lyra&nbsp;by my side grinning as I look at myself in the mirror I have in my room, wearing a cutesy pink satin princess dress with giant shoulder-poufs, we're still like 13, there's even a silver crown on my head, when I'm dressed she kneels for her princess--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--a notebook against my pink overalls, I'm drawing, a fantastical scene with columns and rainbows (I think being a girl made me feel free to draw silly stuff like that) and I touch a pink place with my pen and it glows, bright: I've just discovered what I am--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We're back in the whaleship but I'm still drowning in the visions I can see now are my heart crying where something was torn out.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Discovered what I am...please keep helping me Dreams but first nectar in me I <i>do</i> have a wish. I want what I am all through my body, not just something I know in my head. I wanna bleed rainbows like that vision the Dreams showed me! You can cut me apart to atoms and never find the part that isn't <i>this</i>--I shake my eravahk with its sparkle-dust and shiny rainbow chain binding Boobsong to me--just like you can cut me apart forever and never find the part that isn't heartforming Boobsong, and I want that to be true in my body. Everywhere, inside. And game or Dreams I don't know how because I'm totally not into gore but if that wish can be granted I want to <i>see</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Spooky, a super-real skeleton!? That's creepy for you, Dreams--ooh. It's a medical scan of <i>me, </i>and my bones shine rainbow-gleaming dark like the stuff Heart Home is made of. The scan adds organs and flesh like those MRI videos that morph through different densities and everything is shiny and bright-colored like I'm made of candy (though it's still kind of ma-ca-bre because they're all real organs but that's right too). Red blood in blood vessels oozes out of a cut one and turns into rainbow-color blobs each drop a new color and then a puddle of blood shines rainbow-dark with stars and a rainbow nebula in it like a hologram.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Omifuck <b>beautiful!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">YES! YES exactly if that's real I'm so happy now and I can't believe you actually made that so fucking <i>metal </i>THANK YOU!&nbsp;This is going to get kinky, I kind of want to get cut now and--no, no, let's get Mama to spank me till I bleed and see what <i>she </i>thinks of it. Yes. Bwaha.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Swirly gusher milkshakes I needed that--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Blowout, overload, the the the static riding on it like the dark crust of white-hot lava is my bed in Stamford just there normal--FINE CUT ME YOU WON'T FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR NO MATTER HOW SMALL YOU TEAR ME UP YOU PIECE OF SHIT BASTARDS.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm in the moment that tore me up, the reason I had to leave Earth when I was fifteen or should have in a just world. It was over after this. I know the Dreams showed me my dad changing his view and seeing me right before this and supporting my transness in his kindly overdone way to prepare for this but I could have watched a thousand lifetimes of his staring at Picard's vinyard and <i>seeing </i>and not feel better than I do now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The real vision, the one my heart is screaming about, is my bed strewn with the tiny shreds of my little porn collection after my brothers searched my room for it while I was out and tore it into tiny pieces because--why, even? Because porn is bad mmkay, because our household was a conservative religious one, because they were acting out for attention, the things I understood and thought are all like that crust on lava--and so is the reason it hurt. There was epic drama afterward because I freaked out too hard to keep the whole thing secret from my parents and I stretched to see them as taking my brother's side (the younger was too young to have been doing anything but follow his big brother's lead), but none of that is why this hurt me or why I'm reacting like this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">He forced his way under my covers and saw Lucy Starlight in there and his response was to tear her to shreds. The only one of my family who saw through my eggshell responded with hate Eden would have been proud of.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Hate for me, and for Boobsong. My Picture-girl picture was there, worked on for months to try to capure her, and instead of tearing it up too he mocked it, using the pen I kept with it to scribble on it until she was Popeye, so that I wouldn't even be able to tape it back together. There was some insulting speech-bubble I can't remember or don't want to.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">And that told me what my family thought of the real me, because whenever he acted out my mom talked about her stupid birth-order book that said the middle child expresses the things the family can't talk about.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I know now that I should have left then--and wonder why I <i>didn't</i>. This moment should have been the one I stabbed to create a door for myself and Boobsong.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">No matter. If I couldn't leave the universe I should have left Stamford because that was the moment in which I learned they loved Leo and hated Lucy and wanted her to die--to say nothing of Boobsong in <i>any</i> form. I should have walked in there, seen that, left a note that said just "I hate you too" and never looked back.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">When I woke up to Boobsong in my bed I think I thought somewhere inside that's what we <i>were</i>&nbsp;doing, and that's how I got my age screwed up. I still can't understand how anything else happened--yeah, seed-ghosts don't split families up, but some familes do that just fine without help.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Light is ready, waiting, infinite inside me, if I'd had this in Eden's Unicron room I would have taken out that entire universe by crashing it like I did to Eden's bad timelines...but what can I nuke? If I could kill them all I wouldn't and not just because apparently some part of me still at least loves my parents.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Dreams I wish she did. I wish she came for me the night <i>after </i>this happened and we left I don't want this prevented because this was the day my family's true colors came out. This tableaux is <i>their</i>&nbsp;rainbow blood, I see now, however enlightened my dad might have managed to be in that other thing this was the truth in a world where luxhi'khora couldn't manifest physically to restrain him with social expectation or the Contract with Satan or whatever. If we're changing history let me see this let the sick little drama play out and then get me the fuck out of there and let Boobsong be my rescuer because she got this just as square in the face as I did.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They show me the pastel rainbow scene on the chest of my white shirt from the previous vision framed by my pink overalls, then "<u>L&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </u>", the name-slot on some school paper or another, the first letter of my name written in, but which one?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My heart jams like it keeps doing and I feel sick.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Journey: I'm looking at the closed door of my room watching the rainbow(!) sparkles of a Federation forcefield going up over it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The little die-cast Enterprise-D we thought must have somehow unconsciously triggered me to cast the forcefield is in the center of my view and a weird sob chokes me as I see another flash of my first real Girl outfit with the rainbow on the chest.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This is a memory, I can't control it. I turn to look at Boobsong like I did, ask what just happened, another flash vision of my rainbow shirt and pink coveralls blits by. We talk, she walks up to the forcefield slinking close past me and pokes at it with her gorgeous ass out--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Star Trek was our thing, my dad and me were the family Trekkers. Boobsong thought it was what I turned to subconsciously when we needed safety but why would I go for Red Alert Shields Up in a moment like that in the first place?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My heart hurts like a half-melted gummibear full of jagged shards of ice when it beats, and I see that first outfit with it's cutesy rainbow scene again, half-laugh: Carebears! I liked them when I was five. The overalls make me think of my obsession with OshKosh overalls when I was that age. Is this outfit some kind of...retry? What I should have worn then and you can get away with that at 13 if you're a girl? I didn't think they made pink ones, let alone tween sizes. Brass button gumdrops my dad was such a melodramatic guilt monster he'd totally do something like that to Make Up For It on finding out he'd been missing that I'm a girl all this time.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I try to keep watching Boobsong and me leave but the vision of the overalls outfit just stays.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">And stays.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">...oh my sweet every-color-cum-flavored bubble tape with rainbow glitter and too much powdered sugar&nbsp;<i>the Four Dreams are&nbsp;Care Bear Stare-ing me.</i></p>
