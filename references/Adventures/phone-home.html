<article class="chapter 80---phone-home">
    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">80 - Phone Home</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A sound of gears and motors rumbles through the cabin, and I turn us around, but nothing seems to be happening in here, but the sound is louder from the rear of the ship where the Big Chocobo is so I lead us through into there to see a giant, swooping-frame reflector telescope with what must be a twenty foot mirror rotating into position. Lights gleam along a strip on the concave back and it opens on a not-at-all anime blue-and-green planet with some very familiar continents.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My thoughts boil like hot candy as I march us up to it. What's it aiming at? Are we suppposed to see something, or notice that in our hands with Lyra to make mirrors and a solid tube that can take my heat and the power I just showed Eden and the fact that I'm pretty sure knowing my nature now I can feel all kinds of things with light I can just <i>do </i>like wiggling my fingers including <i>lasing </i>all that output this is a scalpel with which to cut time iteself in half.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The eyepiece is high in the center of the primary mirror, with a catwalk under it and stairs leading up. I climb us up it, got srtaight to the eyepiece, and look in.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A castle, three-quarter perspective because of where it is on the surface, catapults on the battlements, people doing things to them, we're zoomed in on the top of the front gate tower where it sticks up from the treeline. How--joystick on a pedastal, hard to mistake. I pan right, up, the platform moves on implacable bearings,&nbsp;<i>that is a very familiar zepplin!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Mama's there! You're watching through my eye, right?"<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess I am but how is that possible that's Strawberry castle I remember it perfectly!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I scroll around some more, in the sky above the castle this time, what was that speck <i>oh my sweet boiliing poprock blowjobs there we are.</i><br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Your dragon form is so fucking metal."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Is there magnification adjust? Two arrows on the base of the joystick. I press down and look through again and watch Sweden, where yes, my mom's family is from, zoom to a tiny green finger on a pale blue dot. The climate's different, though, there's barely any snow and it's all a lush green with wispy clouds over it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Strawberry Dynasty ended before the crown came to Mama, say, about thirty thousand years ago, maybe, before the beginning of <i>recorded</i>&nbsp;history?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"It never even was a worldgate, it was<i>&nbsp;</i>a <i>timegate. </i>Okay so ass, you, me, I get it, why are we showing me this other than the wham line of the Strawberry World being--wait, this world has like five minutes to live, right? Thus creating some trouble for the entire rest of human history?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"How can that be, though, you and me are still here, and so was Earth until you destroyed it the next time!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I don't know but stabbing it to death twice is kind of satisfying."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh my god. I <i>did </i>fix it better. This might not be the beginning but it stabbing this to death sure is better than making a few adjustments in the 80s.&nbsp;<i>Why didn't it fix things!?</i>&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"The timegate. We must have been like, outside time somehow going to the future--but there should have <i>been </i>no future? What kind of--of--bubblegum hair is this? I FUCKING KILL YOU IN THREE MINUTES! HAVE THE GOOD GRACE TO DIE FROM IT!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I shake my fist at the world, silly-dreadful. They still come with effort, but every candy swear, especially if I can make them raunchy too, makes me feel a little more <i>alive, </i>a little more <i>here, </i>a little more <i>me.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess that's impossible or at least it should be! Could something put Earth back after you killed it maybe? Could Eden have like a backup?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"We're going to find out soon but I don't think this is actually the point. I said this is the ride <i>back </i>from the moon because I saw <i>our </i>moon out the side window, but there was a moon in front of us when we came in here. This ship is headed to go fight the final boss, in the past. Of course you went for SquareSoft, but the Epoch doesn't have any space for sexy beds or childhood healing!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"How can you kill Eden before it becomes that computer thing if the computer thing was there for you to blow up in the future? Is it already the computer thing someplace--that's right it is sis said it started out as the computer and made Earth's universe later!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The game moves my hand on the joystick and makes me zoom in again--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"BWAHAHAAHA OH MY HOLY TRIFORCE GOBSTOPPERS YOU SEE THIS RIGHT!?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There on a zipline using her sheathed sword as a pulley, Mama is sliding from Isht Visht's gondola to the castle dressed in a bright green tunic with white sleeves.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I KNEW IT I SAID SHE WAS WHEN SHE SAID THAT ABOUT GADGETS I WAS LIKE RADA IS TOTALLY LINK I BET SHE INSPIRED HIM!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Except like, she's <i>played </i>Zelda. There's no way Isht Visht would let her not."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"SWEET, PRINCESS THAT MEANS YOU'RE ZELDA!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"What I am is confused. We're still missing something. Here, look at this with your own eye and zoom around, see if you see anything."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess moves me in front of it good touching move me so comforting peek into it which was should I move though left feels good I guess...battlements...Isht Visht and Rada's zipline...right maybe um...scrollscrollscroll...there's me in my dragon shape I do look pretty metal don't I bwahahaha zzzaaap stupid army ruining everything! Take that with your weapon things, don't need those anymore now!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Suddenly I'm crying and only half understand why and think I understand why and I have the nub of an understanding for how to inspire our younger selves but I'm afraid it's still too much of a <i>mission</i>&nbsp;will it work game this isn't the time for me to be clever or independent or all that enlightened princess stuff this is time for me to <i>fix it</i>&nbsp;and if the right way is for you to just tell me the aswer then do.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me a laser-blasting drone from Transformers, referencing my nub of a plan.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Full tears now, which, spike me what a bitch I am this is how I know I'm really a princess be useful and exactly what's needed.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Is there anything still to see back here, Dreams, Game? DON'T LET ME MESS THIS UP!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A lantern from&nbsp;Soefta'xrn, and the lantern from Zelda 3. Something with Mama. Cocksleeve, can you see what she's up to?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I grab her horn gently to ride here eyesight, and the castle is in front of me again.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Looking for Rada scrollscrollscrroll there's Isht Visht and her hookshot but she's inside Princess I don't think--wait that light she has a lantern it must be! Zoom in yus I can see through the window!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">What is she doing...looking around what's in there...books and old papers, searching the room very fast papers and books flying everywhere...pushing the shelves down what's she mad about Princess Rada's so peaceful I've never seen her like this!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"It's something specific. Can you scan the room somehow? Just digitize--cocksleeveize heh--the entire archive?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Rrraaah sending xray scan pulse...nothing comes back...</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"No Princess I think we're ghosts just watching this. I'm watching the scrolls though I remember everything she rolls out! It's not very interesting though just like accounts and stuff. That one had stories! Oooh royal archives like who had what kid and stuff."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"DAMMIT MAMA YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS I'LL ALREADY SUCK YOUR DICK FOR A THOUSAND YEARS JUST FOR ADOPTING ME!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">As if I needed to be crying harder.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess what is it-oooh. She found it look."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There, standing in the window to hold it over her head up to the goddess-light to make sure it's what she thinks it is, Mama is gazing at a ribboned-and-sealed document that can only be my birth certificate.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"We need to make a stop in like 1983 at some point, so I can muse Shigeryu a thing."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess that's amazing how did you guess it?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"What's the one thing you've seen make Mama freak out even slightly?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"You, Princess--oooh. She thought she might not get you. Even just that paper okay yes I understand Rada it's like that."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"If it's possible to fry from being loved I'm going to be the Fairy that finds out, between the two of you."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The light changes in the view, Mama bolts from the view, and I stomp the Zoom Out arrow so we can see what my apocalypse looks like from the other side of the sky--ooh. They're stabbing through the <i>universe, </i>not the sky of the Earth. It looks like the swords must be lightyears long, but each one reaches a tip down down caress the Earth, pricking a hole in reality where someone will have called for me--how does <i>that</i>&nbsp;work? The instruction to call my name was the last thing I did!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: I can dreamtalk instructions to one of my priestesses later. I have eternity to get around to it, as long as I get to it sometime.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Alright Game I need to dreamtalk my priestess that sometime but please make it a hidden goal so I won't think about it till I'm doing it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="v5MELBxAO"><br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The sense of the Goals system showing me a new Goal comes over me, but I see nothing. Perfect.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I feel ambivalent watching Earth die from this angle. It looks so vulnerable from space, and I'm destroying my ancestral home--no, I won't think that way. War and betrayal and infighting destroyed my anscestral home. My mom didn't get that even from this apocalypse. It takes a lifetime to build the kind of fear she carried. If this did that to her, yes, let it burn, we'll build something better, where that doesn't happen to people.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I can't make it stick. Something inside me remembers those stones and cries for them, even though it also remembers the death lurking around every corner.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I fucked up so bad, cocksleeve."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Oh Princess!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Wait, rrah "Princess you did this on purpose you said BURN and then you said wait not burn let people out to the Four Dreams and stabbed super very precisely it's a good thing Princess it just means you had to leave your castle! That's not so bad, is it? It's not your fault anyway you tried to stop everything, remember?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Keep telling me that for a few million more years and I might be able to hear you."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">But as much as I look and cry I do start to realize, I don't want this castle back.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Which makes it weird that I spent my entire childhood building it out of legos over and over again. Brutal grey battlements of rough-hewn stone, the tall gate-tower to fit the portcullis with platforms on either side now bearing catapults, the heavy curtain wall going around it...the Strawberry Dynasty had to be very practical defending their home, even if the actual living buildings were nice.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Heh. I probably should have guessed the wham line when it was <i>strawberries</i>&nbsp;and not some weird alien fruit Mama probably can't wait to introduce me to.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I never made catapults, but I think I know why now. I was sick of war before I could crawl. What I wanted was to see the castle without them. Lyra remembers clearly enough, that's obvious.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Sparks glitter at the places the swords pierced, and the universe in the telescope bursts like popped bubblegum, leaving a black void in its place.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Will we seen Eden restore from backup if we wait here long enough?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I wait a few minutes, cuddling Lyra as she looks for us, but nothing happens. I guess it's not time for that yet.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Alright. Let's do this--wait. Game, where's my juice that breaks bread with his disciples? Is it not time for that yet?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Except I know, it's right here running down my cheeks and thundering in my heart. It's the courage to even try this, as pathetic as that sounds it's a couple of <i>kids.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>Eravahk, make your leash invisible, and even heavier.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It grows even heavier in my hand, and the leash turns clear and disappears.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">RRrrah sweet "Harder Princess make it pull my head down so I can't lift it!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Careful what you wish for--but you have to look pretty now. They won't care you're naked, right? It's like filtered or something? Come on now."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I pull us away from the telescope, will myself soft again, and lead back down the stairs.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"No Princess it's just like you saw before they muse not visually dreamtalk."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Okay."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm rushing us through the ship now, anxious to get there and do this. Game, Dreams, cocksleeve if I'm leaving something undone please please please stop me don't let me mess up just so I can say it was my choice not this time please.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Reece's Pieces. I'm not swearing though I should be, that's just what the Dreams show me. Phone home.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">OH MY GOD IM ALREADY CRYING AS HARD AS I CAN BE! I guess that's approval though.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The words of my speech rattle through my head as we walk through the bedroom. <i>--I mean, I AM guns, look--</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Here's the door to the cockpit-room. Here goes, gulp.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess you can do it. You can just be strong and go in there and be honest. I see you and everything you're thinking of saying is true so say it!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She's a demon. Despite all her submissiveness she can read me totally and knows my every weakness and insecurity and can seduce and manipulate and push buttons with the best of them and <i>that means whereever I'm falling she's right there to shore me up. </i>I'm the one who blew it up but I'm not and she says I'm honest I can believe <i>her </i>even if I can't believe myself.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">If I can believe that here that's what <i>demon</i>&nbsp;means, maybe I can belive a manipulative princess can be a good thing too.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I step forward, and the door slides open.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We walk through, and there they still are, quietly building.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It takes <i>work </i>to make my self--still in my stocking feet, aah--no that's good it's appropriate I'm approachable now. This is nothing like the courtyard where I could bluster and beat people into listening and submission even in the process of inspiring them, here I have to fill them with fire without hurting or scaring them.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">As I turn and kneel with them with my dress splaying royally out around me and gesture Lyra to join us it hits me how horrifically, sickeningly backwards Earth has things that grownups play politics with each other and apply spankings to children. Grown-ups are the ones who can take being thrown around, not kids.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Kneel with Princess and little Princess and me. Smile see I'm back like I promised!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Hehe so cute they look just like us!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Hi there," I waver as sweetly as I can, "how's your spaceship coming? I heard it was super cool."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Introductions bored me so much at this age.</p>
<p data-voice-id="sFn2MPLgP">"It's good! Look, it has skek thrusters and ion drives too!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Cool! I know ion drives, but what're skek thrusters?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="oPAznjZQ5">"They use crystal power from the Skeksis' dark crystal! That was my idea!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh my god it's physically not possible to remember how cute you are at any age but especially this one.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Oooh. Sounds dangerous. I bet it's really powerful, though, right?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="sFn2MPLgP">"It's not too bad unless you break one. Then they explode!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I hope your shock absorbers are good then! Hey, you wanna see some magic? I'm actually a light sorceress."</p>
<p data-voice-id="sFn2MPLgP">"Is that why your wand is glowing and sparkly? Can you actually do magic real magic and not just tricks?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Yup! If you let me build with your Legos I can do the coolest thing! I just need a few, I know you have a spaceship to build."<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay whoever even wants to advise me this is the part I can't figure out because I'm pretty sure I can do the magic for real and make it look mindblowing and I don't know if that's what I need here or exactly the wrong thing.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There dreams show me bioluminescent fish, glowing beautifully in the dark.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">You're <i>kidding. </i>Seriously, dreams?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Green checkmark.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Holy fuck. I keep forgetting there's more magic left in any Earth I'm talking to here than the nightmare I came from--AAH I have to remember how to do it myself first!</p>
<p data-voice-id="sFn2MPLgP">"If you can teach me magic you can have all my Legos!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That makes me smile, because this is so totally me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Check this out, then."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Handmaiden you see what I want to build when they say yes keep the Legos coming in the right sizes and worst possible colors.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"This is just Legos I'm not doing the magic yet."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Find legos one by two white one by four yellow yes its rainbow but wrong one one by six no one by two and one by four different colors grey and blue...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">In no time, with Lyra's magic of finding in this case exactly the <i>wrong</i>&nbsp;parts I have a jumble-colored heart that's not even made out of all full-height bricks. She even expertly made sure it wouldnxt be too colorful to start with.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Okay, now check this out."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's a knot in my throat as I do it. The first moment I started to know what I am I used to destroy something, and while I'd like to think my supernova was beautiful and I definitely removed some ugliness from the world thus making it on average a lot more beautiful I'm sad that's how I discovered myself. If this in some sense fixes that that will be worth it just for that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>This</i>&nbsp;is what my power's made for. This is what I'm supposed to be.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's no <i>remembering</i>&nbsp;how to do it. It's a part of me. I <i>am </i>this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I take Lyra's hand and hold it tight, look at her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Aww handholding!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Ooooh you can do it! Princess you're so wonderful sweet awesome good! Shine, Princess--yus it's working!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My light, dimmed with an-ang-being scared, suddenly shines bright as I cry from her praise, and with my other hand I hold the Lego heart and imagine the way it should look. Colors flow in my hand, exchanging and rearranging, until a beautiful rainbow heart sits in my hand. As a last step I pour light like water into it to make the colors glow bright and neon--if the 80s hadn't been starting as I came to Earth, I would have had to invent them to be happy--and hand it to my young self. She takes it and holds it in both hands, face wearing an expression only looking at Lyra outdoes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's no <i>how</i>&nbsp;to any of it, nothing like the <i>technique</i>&nbsp;of aetherwork or even coming up with good wishes for the Dreams. I just <i>do it</i>, it's what I am.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Want to learn how? You're a light sorceress too, you can, you can even glow like me. And lots of other stuff but not many powers are cooler than always having the right colored Legos!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Lyra's right. I believe this with all of my heart.</p>
<p data-voice-id="sFn2MPLgP">"They don't even make purple-pink Legos! How did you do this?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Let me teach you! First you have to hold your friend's hand. Can my friend give her a job?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They join hands as hungrily as Lyra and me ever have, and little me nods.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">You know what to do, cheerleader.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes Princess!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Okay so look at your friend now. Isn't she the <b>best</b>? Just look at her. Look how awesome cool fun she is and say it! That's the most important job because everything else is just her knowing you think she's the best awesome friend you could ever have ever in a million billion years and wanting to play with you because she knows it'll make you happy to be with her having fun. Tell her now just say it!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="oPAznjZQ5">"You're the best the BEST--look you're glowing COOL now you're even more the best!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="sFn2MPLgP">"Whoah! I didn't do anything what happened!?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"She told you about the light inside you and you got happy because you could see it too and it shined out of you because you were looking at me and knew you're a light sorcess and the light she makes shine in you can actually make you glow. Now, you don't actually have to glow to do light magic--usually, some things are special--but it's still very important. Do you know why?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Little me shakes her head.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"One, because it's <i>beautiful," </i>I hold up my shining hand that seems to shimmer multicolored without flickering, "and two--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I lean forward, make a fist on my thigh, grin with tears still in my eyes <i>squidgy root-beer gummies I really do just believe all of it</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Being able to glow is <i>so. cool.</i>"</p>
<p data-voice-id="oPAznjZQ5">"She's right this is so awesome! Hehe everytime I say good things you get brighter! You are so fun and cool!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Sad as I am, they have me smiling.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Okay, ready for the good part? Now you need your imagination. Imagination is the most important thing any light sorcercess has because without it your power doesn't work. The Legos <i>will</i> change, but only after you imagine them changed so much you already believe it happened. That's it, though, it's that simple! Try it, change them however you want, they're your Legos!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She looks at the legos, closes her eyes, and in a moment they're a red heart outlined in one 'pixel' of black which is impressive (except it's just that I didn't think to tell her it was impossible so she just <i>did it)</i>&nbsp;because the Legos it's made of don't have the one pixel outline physically.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Good job! Now I dare you to try the brightest pink you can, and then make it glow like I did. I bet you can even figure out how to make stuff glow without me telling you."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She holds it up, it goes pink, and her hand suddenly looks black against the brilliance and I laugh with happiness to see her overshoot like that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"You're strong! I knew you could figure it out. Being a light sorceress is just what you <i>are, </i>there's lots of other stuff and the secret of our magic is you already know how to do all of it, just use your imagination."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I seem to have her attention now so I plunge in. Maybe this won't do anything or it's already unnecessary who <i>cares </i>if anyone wants me not trying to fix stuff they should stop giving me time machines.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Now I have an even more secret powerful magic to teach you. This is the most powerful magic there is. Nothing can break it, super nothing, so listen carefully, because there are people who will tell you it's fake to hide it from you. See your friend? How you hold hands and spend time together? Wouldn't it be the coolest if you were <i>always</i>&nbsp;together, and there was magic holding you together so that even when you weren't holding hands you were connecting, and even if your friend fell down a bottomless pit its power would just bring her right back to you?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Her eyes are like saucers. That's a yes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Here's the big secret. You and her are like her and me. That magic is how you're together in the first place. You're doing it right now by holding hands but it stays going all the time anyway. If Unicron himself came and tried to undo your hands he'd break his arms trying and if he didn't stop he'd probably blow up like you opened the Matrix. People might try to trick and make you think she's fake, or gone, but nothing can ever, ever take her away and you can't lose her either and I don't have to tell you she's totally real! If you don't see her, just look around, she's somewhere. My friend likes to be silly and do stuff like ride on pizza boxes or turn into a pony and I get confused but she's always right there and it makes me smile which is why she does it. I bet you're the same, aren't you?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The last to little Lyra.</p>
<p data-voice-id="oPAznjZQ5">"I love riding pizza boxes! They're just the right size and it's warm."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">How did I survive this much cute at <i>any </i>age?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I <i>thought</i> so. Want to know how it works?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">As if I have ever once answered <i>no </i>to that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She nods violently.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"My friend needs to give your friend a job again to show you. Can she?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">More nodding.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My little self needs a hug like you gave me to show me you're in me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">I see Princess!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Okay so this is weird but it's real just believe it. Feel how your body's right there holding hands with her? You have something else that's just as much you as your body. It's with her already like she's holding you in her hand because you're small. Feel it?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes you say nodding.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Okay now squeeze it like hugging her and stop after as long as a hug takes."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My little self's mouth opens in surprise.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"You're friend's body is there holding hands with you so you play and have fun together. Did you just figure out where your <i>friend </i>is?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Nodding more.</p>
<p data-voice-id="sFn2MPLgP">"Inside my heart! Is she like a monster inside of me?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"It's even better than that. She's made of magic, so she lives in your soul, and but she can hug with her magic and your body feels it just like happiness feels light and sadness hurts. You're wound up so tight together nobody can ever take you apart again, but she's still her and you're still you. It makes me cry every time I think about it--me and my friend are like that too--because it's so cool. You keep her perfectly safe always. Humans are super tough and inside the soul of a human who loves you is one of the safest places anywhere if you're made of magic."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess we should tell them the spell you said we should try!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Good--good idea! This is more magic with your friend using the power I was just talking about. Take your hands and make a heart shape like this with your fingers.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I squeeze Lyra's hand and let it go and (stick, eravahk) make "my sign" with thumbs tip to tip and index fingers against each other to make a heart.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Little me imitates.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Now put it against your heart where you felt your friend's hug just now. You can get closer than I can hehe but if you can't like I can't after you grow up it won't hurt it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She does this too.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Now we need music. What song makes you think of playing with your friend or just her being there more than any other song? I have every song, it's part of my powers, even stuff from movies and shows."</p>
<p data-voice-id="sFn2MPLgP">"Oh um it's like--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She hums a few bars in my silly childish way from that age that<i>&nbsp;maybe I should start doign again it was fun</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Dreams, if there's any slight mercy to you you make that song sound like heaven itself right now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They...gulp...okay that works...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Now when it feels right in the music, say her name three times like you're calling for her to come to you."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She waits, poised, and suddenly in my third eye I'm back in the farmyard at Plowstar like the other visions that have come over me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay why am I here what is this was I calling for Freddie or wishing he would come down from Greentop is this just--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--oh this totally did something didn't it--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--some incredibly epic rocket with literally twelve engines like something out of anime doing it's ignition sequence, engine after engine roaring to life and then I can <i>feel </i>the acceleration, the sheer awesomeness gives me chills--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--Lyra perched precariously (but that's so obivously the idea) on the top of a huge candy-stretching machine, turning the crank, one false move away from being snared in what must be 300 pounds of hot candy there to be stuck until it cools enough that I can eat her...out...bwahahaha--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--a beautiful garden with many-colored flowers and a little square except it's <i>rounded </i>building made of rainbow-iridescent rock like my eravahk with little dark spots like Lyra and and curly-stemmed creeping purple flowers like the monoliths but real climbing it, water, a bigger house of the same kind of in the background--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--a rainbow-colored creature like a cross between a dog and a lizard but as brightly colored as the rest of this world up on its hind legs to look in a window in a wall of the same softly round rainbow-sheen beauty at people playing some video game wtih unbelievable graphics on an also unbelievably huge screen that stars an anime maid--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--Lyra (naked) and me (also bareassed, though I have my stockings) in a hot air balloon bwahahah it's not hot <i>air </i>it's literally a giant party balloon with the bottom tied off and everything, iridescent like I'm super fast remembering to be my favorite "color" after "Lyra", trussed up with shining ropes and a diamond-looking gondola, floating off on the winds of the True Sea to who even knows where which is so obviously the <i>point</i>--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--the iridescent stone from an earlier vision hanging on its chain in a frame with a black satin background, waiting for the Starlight Princess to take it up and wish her way on it to worlds of imagination--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--the living room I saw the family relaxing in after the housewarming parties except now anything but the screen is visible and I can see a space made of the same iridescent-silver-rainbow stuff with comfy couches and a big central thing that's also the pillar the screen is on this is the view in the window from the previous vision bwhaha that's right there's a wavy fun bouncycastle <i>waterslide </i>(why not, we were naked all the time anyway!) down from the upstairs (the living room is nice and tall in case I get fidgety and need to flap around a little) and the rainbow-shiny stuff isn't <i>rock </i>it's <i>bouncy </i>what is Heart Home going to be made of but heart<i>stone--</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>--</i>the entry table on the way into the living room with its heart-shaped picture of Lyra and gemstone old-timey phone made so the speaker looks like a dark purply gemstone rose in a vase--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--lights playing on the silvery curved wall of the house and porch from the luminous plants in the terraced back garden, gently moving almost like water as the wind stirs them--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--standing in a garden of black-stemmed, pale blue flowers a curving little building in Isht Visht green with an almost nautical way--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--looking down at a beautiful red flower in a square vase in my hand, then up at windows that shine with sunlight but <i>inside </i>them a huge flower garden overrun with blazing color overgrows the enitre side of the room--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--the rainbow-colored creature again, shiny-domed heartstone rocks and spiky-soft purple grass with a stream lined with Johnny Jump-ups in the foreground, Lyra and me lying on round rainbow-hologram-black pillows on a shiny-dark blanket, I'm sprawled and she's half on top of me feedling me something we're picknicking--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The deck is rumbling and the ship shaking with the power of those rocket engines I saw. We're <i>going somewhere.</i>&nbsp;When I twist around to see the viewscreen, the Lego moon is replaced by--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">GAAAAASP "Princess it's Heart Home we made it we're going there that's why the ship is fast now it must be!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A rainbow-iridescent asteroid of the same smooth bouncy shine&nbsp;as Heart Home, different bulbous shapes stuck together like 90s computer graphics floats in the void with the True Sea in the background. Flat floating rocks like stepping-stones make yards out front and, I know, out back, and they all hang with purple grass and brilliant-colored flowers--it's there's a bright, and I do mean <i>bright</i>, opposite to <i>pastel</i>&nbsp;in the multiverse, I'm it. The ship plows through a flock of deep-purple butterflies of the kind that live around it as we fly, and it's perceptibly getting closer, though we have a bit yet, and--swizzlesticks I didn't even notice everything about it is anime, like, of course. All the visions of it were, too, but it fit so naturally I didn't think about ti even slightly.</p>
<p data-voice-id="v5MELBxAO"><i><strike>Top, Build your Heart-Home out of thousands of Legos, Correct-colored heart-pieces</strike></i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This time I don't have to ask what the "correct colored heart peices" are. I just made them.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It looks awesome, and also, such a <i>relief, </i>the perfect balance to the camp--the camp is <i>awesome, </i>but it's almost <i>too </i>good, every inch of it sacred, an achingly beautiful hymn to everything I ever loved or that made me happy, a temple of beloved memories out of which Mama's entire hoard <i>including </i>my birth certificate couldn't purchase one since tuft of carpet fuzz. Being there is <i>so happy </i>but it feels every moment like the slightest touch will send me into nostalgic weeping that melts into the soggy joy of reunion the minute I open my eyes and look at literally anything in there.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Heart Home is a big shiny balloon with a water slide and <i>cool&nbsp;</i>bedrooms. It has no meaning except to be silly comfy sexy pretty fun, a weird castle for an alien princess--except that's a meaning in itself, because that weird shiny alien fun with the colors so bright they probably make normal humans dizzy honors what kind of monster I am inside just as much as the camp does what kind of human.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm going to need both. Good thing I have a couple of spaceships to fly between them in--right, bouncybutt? This thing isn't leaving us once it we get there?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Of course not Princess I can't give you an Arwing and not also make the Big Whale and the Epoch! The Epoch is sealed though, we have to find it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Naturally. I twist back to look at her and imagine the kiss she's get if there weren't kids here, then check our young selves.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They're back to building, absorbed, working on their same starship.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I had so many melodramatic big plans, and please tell me Dreams or Game if I shoudl still do them, but--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"You know what would be the <i>coolest</i>? If you had a house that was made of shiny bouncy balloon stuff and had a waterslide in the living room with those curves that make you feel like you're flying and there were beautiful bright flowers light Johnny Jump-ups everywehre&nbsp; and it floated in space so your two spaceships could dock and you had a rock that could take you anyplace you imagined by wishing on it. I think you should build it after--no, no--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I get my excited little-kid voice on. "--you should build it <i>before</i>&nbsp;you finish your ship because don't want to have a cool place to live while you work on your ship? And have picnics on floating rocks and one of those cool old-fashioned phones?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I always thought these were the coolest, and that was <i>before</i>&nbsp;I saw how gorgeous one can be.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Can you imagine what kind of fun you could have there?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Oh, and a huge candy factory in the kitchen because candy, obviously. That way you can never run out ever."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">...um, I wonder how much faster this ship can go.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"And everything should be the funnest colors. No green grass allowed! Green <i>sky</i> sounds kind of fun though, doesn't it? It's like a whole other world, with totally different kinds of adventures in it. I bet you can't imagine them and make them as weird and fun as it is!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="sFn2MPLgP">"Oh yeah? Can so!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="oPAznjZQ5">"Yeah! Come on, she's right don't you want such a cool house to play in? I'll beat you down the water slide!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The get up and run off and disappear and I start crying the hardest yet--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess I'm coming RAAH JUMP!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She's wrapped around me before the first tear falls, and I just sit there crying and hugging her for a long time, but as I do, something strange and wonderful happens.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Those are silly cliche words so that's why I pick them.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm not sure really what my tears are. Touching our past like that and playing was...even in this magical place a sweet circle seemed to close around us, and now it's gone but I'm here with Lyra and heart-home is up ahead and all the gentleness I held for a kid I think I've never managed to actually be kind to until this moment which is probably why I'm crying is transformed through the seething iron resolve I've brought to each of my explosions into, well, the furious energy of a cartoon character. It's not the fidgety overcaffienated impatience of my base hyperactivity, either, it's a force I'm going to have to learn to draw on and channel like my light, but...that heartstone up ahead had better be as tough as what Lyra's made of.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Having seen my past self like that made me choose as she disappeared: let her enthusiasm and innocence fade into the past with her, or decide there was nothing to grieve because they're here with me now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I choose here with me now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">So what kind of weird adventures <i>will </i>that rock lead to? What's floating in the anime Sea around here? What kind of weird kinky worlds are on the other side of my grown-up imagination now that it's primed with age-play and all of <i>this?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I don't know but I can't <i>wait </i>to find out<i>.</i>&nbsp;If I weren't busy hugging Lyra and crying I'd be leaning forward with that dangerous-cute grin and my fists on my thighs again.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Swirly-colored ringpops that's all so COMPLICATED! They were cool and now they're gone and I miss them!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay <i>now</i> I'm crying fuck. I always thought I was <i>so annoying. </i>That little me was adorable.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I kiss the top of Lyra's head and think about ways we can make tag fun with our <i>new toys</i>&nbsp;we got puberty ago. It'll already be fun with the flying, and the floating rocks and stuff...</p>
