    <p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">RAAAH PRINCESS I'M JUMPING Just follow me into the memories! Get ready Princess we're going now! <b>PRAH!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We're in the house with the candy bowl. I'm staring at the slate bricks of their fireplace, jumble-sized and sticking out from the mortar 50s-style. I think we're getting ready to go.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess now listen it's okay you can do this it's not going to hurt anything. Blow up the house you're in. Shoot it with light beams or get really bright and vaporize all of it but make sure you get all of it don't leave one little piece standing!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Lasers. I've been wanting to try hand-beams. I point my ten-year-old palms at the ugly bland stone of the fireplace and--it whites out my vision for a second so I think all I can do is shine undirectedly but nope those are lasers and I realize the rainbow-flicker thing is just my light-being senses showing me light of all frequencies at once because I'm lasing every frequency at once somehow. Two blinding beams cut through darkness and strike the stone and it explodes with thermal shock instead of melting like I'd planned for to dramatically cut it in half and the fragments of exploding stone slow to a stop halfway from me like they're in water--huh?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Everything is white around me. I don't <i>feel </i>anything but suddenly I'm shining a supernova and the force of my own light has stopped the fragments.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Isn't this <i>wrong</i>&nbsp;though fine it's just a memory nuke it I clench my journey-fists by my sides and pump out enough cold white light to erase half the imagined solar system but is this even remotely the way to say <i>this isn't who I am?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A white void is all that's left after I nuke the house. Lyra's hugging me in the real world but it seems wrong that she's not here in the white void so I put my hands over my heart in the heart-sign and summon her:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Lyra! Lyra! Lyra!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Everything goes weird, the scene changes. Is this the stone table in Narnia? It's rain-slick and brown and smooth instead of the rough granite I imagined it as, but it's definitely something like that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I put my hand up--I'm still ten--and do the summoning spell again, cocksleeve get in here!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Lyra! Lyra! Lyra!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Instead of Lyra appearing, snow covers everything--for exactly as long as it takes me to turn the precision of rage at a computer that's not doing what it's <i>fucking </i>told (because there's no way this is <i>Lyra </i>refusing to join me)&nbsp;&nbsp;into raising my hands and holding two glowing orbs of precisely <i>hot summer day</i>&nbsp;until all the snow melts again--Narnia. Being pulled back down to Earth this was Narnia's pulling back down to Earth I can <i>feel </i>that <i>where is that fucking white witch tease people with candy to manipulate them will you?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">And fuck this edgelord crap with the stone table and everything. How can I make this prettier? Let's give it flowers so bright even <i>I</i> can't look at them. I decide, and there they are, everywhere.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This was my most fantastical story outside the Time Quartet and So You Want To Be a Wizard (which though it probably saved my life with the car idea I used in Limbo was grim as a plate of overcooked pudding) this had that same pulling back to Earth somehow like the fantasy couldn't be fantastic without some kind of downer but what was it I'd like to smite Jadis for being a tease but that wasn't <i>it.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">When the snow is gone (oooh, I melted it the first time too, that's why everything was wet) I climb up on the table to look around--holy fuck there they are trudging through the snow behind those trees, Jadis the white witch and Edmund, with her dwarf helping haul the sled because I'm melting all the snow.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I put my hands down, look at them. Swirly cumdrops it's all made up anyway for purposes of this journey I am now <i>actually </i>the Candy Goddess. I close my fists and open them and each one is holding a Now and Later, close them again, unconjure it, and flounce off toward--no. I'm standing up here on the stone table and I look Edmund's age and I seem to be in my Starlight Princess outfit still.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This <i>is </i>like the house after all but I don't blow the whole thing up by just vaporizing Narnia. Jack's moralizing is about to meet an even deeper magic from outside of time entirely--I agree with some of his morals, but not here!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They stop, and all three of them stare--oh yeah, I'm still glowing! Can I have my wings here duh right made up let's just float up in the air and look adorably terrifying.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">ACK SELF NOT LIKE THE COURTYARD BE <i>CUTE!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"THAT'S SUPER MEAN JADIS! YOU STOP RIGHT NOW!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh that's cute, she's going to statue me. She looks really mad, too, but it's hard to be scary with like fifteen pounds purple bubble gum tangling you wand-hand to your hair!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's all made up, I just decide it's happening and there she is.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">While Jadis panics I drop down and walk toward them. The dwarf looks menacing for about half a second but I raise my eyebrows and he bolts.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Edmund's on the back of the sled looking pathetic and radiating self-pity and trying not to laugh at Jadis.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She glares at me, trying to free her wand, so I delete it and replace it with a rainbow Twizzler (which I've just invented), grab the twizzler and start eating it, turn to Edmund, wave hi brightly (literally I guess but I'm trying to not hurt to be near and it <i>seems</i>&nbsp;to be working) then say over my shoulder to Jadis:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I know bubble gum in your hair is the <i>worst</i>. I'll let you out if you promise to be nice."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She just snarls, so I turn back to Edmund.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Let me guess. You didn't believe your sister this place existed but now here you are except you can't find anyone except <i>her </i>and she seemed nice at first and she gave you candy and said you could have more if you betrayed your friends to her which seemed like a good deal at the time because they'd been totally mean except now she won't give you what she promised and wants you to do even more bad stuff?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Cor blimey, how'd you work that out?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I'm the Candy Goddess Lucy. I know things. Mostly how mean it is to use pleasure to manipulate people. Here. <i>This</i>&nbsp;won't run out on you, give you a stomach ache, or make creepy old magic from when the world was made enslave you to random strangers just because you made the mistake of forgetting that your siblings actually do love you even though they're jerks sometimes."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I conjure a box of Turkish Delight that works like my Happy Meal (but can't resist making it shiny and the candy rainbow-colored with some definitely non-canon flavors), dump it into the snow as Edmund leaps for it, turn it back up to show it still full.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">He grabs it and starts eating hungrily.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Back to the white void. I can feel Lyra hugging me in the real world but am still alone here.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm surprised that blew it up good enough--no, it makes sense. I wrecked the central plot. Edmund needs to learn his siblings love him and from it try to be a better person but there are other ways to tell that story.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">...no TOO COMPLICATED ARGH! These are just times I wanted to explode the container that was holding me for being WRONG! Now that I understand what a shell is to me (my human shell makes me human-shaped which <i>fits </i>but I could have one that didn't fit and feel as bad as this) it's so obvious!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">BURN where's the next one let's nuke a bitch!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I, hehe, heart-form my fingers again.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Lyra, Lyra, Lyra!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">An emergency light? Oh <i>that </i>emergency light. I'm in the hallway at my dad's church now zooming up in the sky to see it laid out bleow me with all its buildings. It gets small enough to see all of them, and just as I set up to blast it with a full-force hand-laser hadoken-style (I mean <i>obviously, </i>I'm some combination of goddess to like one and a half other religions now&nbsp;<i>and</i> banging a demon<i>&nbsp;and...</i>), the scene changes and it's--Midnight Mass? Okay that's actually weird I <i>loved</i>&nbsp;this. The church is beautiful and the candles glow and the music is awesome and presents are coming and the whole thing is kind of awesomely magical and there wasn't any yank-back-to-Earth that I could see. I'd think it just can't fit with Lyra but we already know the awesomely insane hilarious solution to <i>that</i>, so...why is this needing to get nuked?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Because in its current form there still isn't room for Lyra, but it's <i>so easy </i>to fix that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Everyone's getting up and bringing their toys to be at the Nativity Scene with Jesus like the Shepherds and Wise Men. My dad preaches the same sermon for the kids about how <i>anyone</i> can come to see Jesus come into the world <i>especially </i>badguys and so they should bring <i>any toy they want</i>&nbsp;to be at the manger scene. Something something yes war toys soldiers need Jesus especially.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Alright, let's hold him to his candystriping word. He'd want no less from me--oops, here's my pew going!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Enough with the spell. If I can just replace Jadis' wand with candy I just made up Lyra's here if I want her to be. Eject the Autobot in my pocket goes safely back home, and--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">SNUGGLE PRINCESS' HAND SNUGGLY HI!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--is replaced by a tiny and very cuddly silver doll.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Hello, baby Jesus. This time <i>you </i>need <i>me.&nbsp;</i>I'm the Starlight Princess and <i>I</i> have a present for <i>you</i> that's just like one I got when I was your age and <i>my whole life</i>&nbsp;I haven't had a toy I like better. It's not this doll, but she can give it to you...</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Here we go up on table wave hi Jesus make seeds right I can do this you're playing with me it counts--hhhaaah YUS there they go!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Back to the white void. Alright, who's next, who else wants some!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Lyra's gone from the journey, which means you're just there hugging me and not on some imaginary table still, right cocksleeve?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes Princess it kicked me out like how Earth ending kicked out of the castle.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay. Fingers in position...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Lyra! Lyra! Lyra!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Lying in bed in the tent camping with the family the summer I was thirteen, the lantern hanging overhead. Okay this is even easier I'm the Starlight Princess I know what a thirteen year old heartformer needs to be doing this time of night and it's not staring at the ceiling of a tent wedged between their mom and their little brother. Nuke? <i>Bor-ring</i>. Um...why isn't just summoning her here or imagining sneaking (or better yet <i>obivousing)</i>&nbsp;off for sex right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Up the ante and obvious off to elope? Better...we saw Jurassic Park while we were staying here! SPARED NO EXPENSE!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Stupid camping I'm sick of being uncomfortable. Poof my family had infinite money that summer and we're now in the nicest hotel in Camden and Lyra and I are sleeping peacefully together in our own separate hotel room <i>suite </i>with its own kitchen she can make me cupcakes in and where we strip the moment the door closes behind us no Lyra gets the Contract with Satan benefits from the good timeline she doesn't have to wear clothes <i>anywhere </i>why isn't this exploding yet?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The pull back down to Earth <i>was</i>&nbsp;Jurassic Park? Dreams I must be crazy here <i>really?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The red lights of the computer that ran the park until it got shut down so Nedry could steal dinosaur embryos.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I was reading Disclosure that year, too, another Michael Chrichton novel (before I figured out he was kind of a hack) about some corporate espionage thing or another but the good part was a really explicit sex scene that looking back triggered my rape kink--and that was the only interesting thing about it!&nbsp;I shouldn't have even been reading that tedious crap in the first place! My <i>Earth mom</i>&nbsp;took it out because it claimed to be about virtual reality and she had no idea what would be in it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My container that was wrong was that I was a hacker kid like the girl in Jurassic Park.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm nothing of the sort <i>holy cranberry-striped creme eggs I just thought that and it's TRUE.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That was my whole <i>identiy </i>then.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>This </i>should blow some things up. I sit bolt upright in bed and snatch Disclosure off the off the nightstand and glare at it until it remembers it was actually a copy of <i>Music by Starlight</i>&nbsp;which is the first Starlight Princess erotica collection and I don't know what's in there but the book has glow in the dark stars and neon stripes and is an <i>even hornier</i>&nbsp;Strawberry Dynasty type fantastical thing.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Gasp Princess is sitting up fast take book okay where are you going?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Not far. I dive for the duffel bag and dump it on the bed and rifle through my T-shirts. <i>CodeWarrior</i>&nbsp;nope that said <i>Strawberry Princess</i>&nbsp;Marathon gets kept--no. This is all window dressing.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Where is the PowerBook. On the nightstand where I left it, I decide.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My face screws into bitter sad rage as I tear it into my lap and hurl it open and close the game project I was working on. It's going fine but it was the only C-programmed game I finished.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I delete the C compiler entirely. More technical power was never what I needed for what I was looking for all that time. The frustration with HyperCard's limitations was that I couldn't make games that drew me into the other world I was trying to find but fuck that all you need for that is <i>words.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The vision starts to bubble at the edges, I'm doing it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The light of my rage and passion makes the screen hard to see as I open HyperCard and rattle off a script like a hollywood hacker typing furiously without even looking then close the editor press shift-tab to make the mechanical black mirror I've just written (in HyperCard purely to spite the stupid misdirection of the course of my entire life towards trying to accumulate enough <i>technical </i>power to do what I needed when I should been doing <i>this</i>) show Lyra's thoughts and type the first words of the story I'd been trying to write since the very first time I opened MacPaint all those years ago:</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Come on, wake up, Lucy!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The journey detonates back to the white void when I press enter with fury that makes what I did to that perfekti look like a very polite tea party.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh? That's not the end?<i>FUCKING TRY ME! </i>These are just memories but they should be real I need to <i>break some things!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>"LYRA! LYRA! LYRA!"</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">What is this Super Metroid on the TV in the kitchen after everyone goes to bed and I'm trying to see what Samus looks like during the death animation that shows her suit exploding off her using the VCR to pause it. It's night and everyone's asleep and I'm jumpier than poprocks in a frying pan with syrup and water, looking over my shoulder more than at the screen.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Glitch, the screen is now 16-bit Lyra kneeling there full-frontally for my pleasure.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This isn't and won't be the answer but I had to do it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We're in Stamford and I had a room but acted like it was public property. I fly through the kitchen ceiling to get to my room quickly and replace every wall hanging that's not a map of Maine with a pinup of this silver succubus I like, move the hidden mineral oil and hand towel from under the bed onto the nightstand, invent a fancy-looking literal cocksleeve to stand next to them, teleport my little porn collection from between my matresses to the shelf of the nightstand and make it fifty times as big, and telekinesis the door shut. See? I'm even polite about it. I'll bring my own laundry in here, Mom.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Wait one more thing, my bed needs Lyra herself posing naked. There.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">White void. Hands to boob.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"<i>LYRA! LYRA! LYRA!"</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i></i>My shout is getting more confident, from softly calling before now to barking orders.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Where the hell is this? Old computers are stacked everywhere in a cheap apartment and I feel weird dizzy hatred and love mixed equally--this is the future. All those old computers look bleeding-edge to 1995. Even the TV stand is a king's ransom of <i>Quadra 840av's</i>&nbsp;looking as old and run down as our Mac plus. Over the TV is a poster that reads "Rapture, Enjoy the ride!" with a big cross and dog looking up at it's departed own (talking about families torn asunder...).</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My stomach turns: this is the projection forward of the timeline I just nuked by exchanging THINK C and game engines I could never make work right for HyperCard and Lyra's voice.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--and if I'm here cocksleeve so are you and we're writing this bigger. I plop her right in front of me with orders to kneel and display her submission to anyone watching, erase the hoard of old broken computers and replace it with box after box of Starlight Princess and Melody merch and books and pamphlets and games and and and. As a final touch I rub out the rapture poster and replace it with the vision I saw of fire in the sky and Rada standing in the gateway to the Four Dreams but resolve the fire in the sky into the blades I saw stabbing the Strawberry Empire at the castle. There's a <i>real</i> rapture, assholes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh god--no oh dark swirly mustard gobstoppers why do I feel so much did this place <i>happen</i>&nbsp;is this from the future I can't remember please no take this away just get rid of it AAAH!!!!!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Fine. Let's keep going. <i>Here's</i> an explode I don't know how I know and I definitely don't want to:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Come on you guys, we have to unpack all this stuff <i>and </i>set up the farseeing pavillion--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>College</i>&nbsp;this looks like college right what does college look like not this for me I hope oh wait never going what does college have where do you set stuff up.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"--on the green and get the brochures to the student council--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Colleges don't have student councils do they that's a highschool thing who cares this one does now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"--<i>and </i>I haven't fucked Lyra in like three hours!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">White void.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Angry now, but not at you, cocksleeve. White-knuckled heart-shape.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"<i style=""><b>LYRA!! LYRA!! LYRA!!</b>"</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">NOT HERE AGAIN PLEASE NO! Standing in what must be the entryway to the same apartment, reset from being a Starlight Princess green-room to whatever it NEVER WAS SPIKE YOU!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's a girl there, not me but about my size, in the journey I'm still a boy--not for long. How to cause the most carnage in the least words in whatever this fucked up fundie apartment is, sorry not sorry girl who clearly just walked in:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Hey could I try one of your bras? I think I'm trans."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Scene change. Earth from high orbit, crosshairs surround it, the scene goes solid with the number of blades stabbing in, explosion, white void.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Good. Eat it, vid bois.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Back in the whaleship--in front of us there's a wooden crate now, about the size of a milk crate.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Healing is done but I feel a sick ugly feeling at the memory of the apartment, and stare at Lyra and our cleavage to try and chase it away. I want to beg my game or the dreams to prevent me from even thinking of whatever that was again but somehow know not to.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm Lucy Starlight not whatever <i>that life</i>&nbsp;was!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Nothing happens for a minute, so I look at the crate. It's a few squares away--game, I think we need to not start Floor Is Tentacles quite yet please.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: The game of Floor Is Tentacles starts when I finish dealing with the vision I'm processing. I can go investigate the crate safely.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I pat Lyra off me, and crawl to it with her, shaky from that last part. Memories from outside the range I'm supposed to remember was hard.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's a <i>this end up fragile</i>&nbsp;icon in one corner. How to get this open? Cocksleeve, see--oh, no.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I raise a hand and aim ceilingward and hope the ship is laserproof. When my laser is thin, precise, and won't just vaporize the whole crate, I swing it down and slice the top of the crate free carefully.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's amazing how <i>nothing </i>doing the light stuff is. Not that I'm not doing anything, but what does wiggling your thumb <i>feel like</i>?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Open it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Pick up lid carefully still hot ouch take the heat raaah set this aside and look in.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess that's beautiful but what is it?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I look in with her. Inside is a shining silver-and-black trophy with a cup on top.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Take it out, show me."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Raaaah pick up this is heavy sheesh oof hold it up for you to look at.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's almost as big as she is. Held in her hands by side-pillars, I can see there's an engraved plaque on the center part:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"First Place, 2005 Command-only Heartformers' Games. Lucy Starlight and Crystal Starlight."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess my last name is Starlight if yours is we're married that's me isn't it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's a weird knot in my throat suddenly.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I'm damn well not competing in any Heartformers' Games without you!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Confetti explodes from the ceiling like we've just won the trophy, making me giggle, but heavy complex emotions are churning in me. This trophy, aside from giving me a name for her that might explain why <i>Lyra</i>&nbsp;and <i>Melody </i>both feel weird, feels like it <i>does</i> something, and in my forgetful state it's hard to process, but I need my forgetful state--please please please don't take my forgetfulness I need that I think I get why this trophy is here but please...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I stare at it, jammed, feeling like I'll explode.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Melody. Lyra. Music she's <i>music</i>&nbsp;why would I name her Crystal it doesn't feel right either light and crystal obviously the metaphor is clear enough but each of the three names is is is RRR they're all wonderful what's wrong then!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Music and Crystal light beings probably have music made out of light I can see and hear music or something like that it makes sense we probably play crystal instruments but that isn't right crystal is all hard and Lyra is soft like the strings of her instrument or the very word Melody I wouldn't call her Crystal something is wrong here this trophy is real I can feel it but why is the name on it Crystal?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's been painted over again like Mama has! The title is weird too "command only heartformers' games" sounds like the monoliths glitchiness why the fuck would this trophy have that?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Out of nowhere I find myself thinking of the episode of TNG where Data sees Troi as a "cellular peptide cake" as part of a series of hallucinations and nightmares he's having to try to tell everyone about parasites eating both the Enterprise and its crew. He couldn't percieve them directly but his positronic brain picked up on something subconsciously. I feel like that's happening here.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Data saw things eating his friends or images of consumption where there shouldn't be any. I'm seeing Crystal where there should be softness, <i>seedling is missing </i>THAT FUCKING PLAQUE WOULD SAY HEARTFORMER AND <i>SEEDLING</i> GAMES IF I WENT ANYWHERE NEAR THOSE GAMES! I wouldn't play alone even if it was only for me, maybe for StarFox but not some explicitly for heartformers.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Crystal crystal crystal maiden frozen in crystal like Zelda 3 cocksleeve you're right here, aren't you? Are you stuck in a crystal? Seedling missing because she's frozen in crystal but you're <i>not </i>you're <i>here</i>&nbsp;and even if you were twins or something I'd never compete with only one of you but I only <i>want</i>&nbsp;one of you so that can't be right anyhow I don't think I'd name <i>any </i>seedling Crystal.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Cocksleeve full smarts on this where are you frozen in crystal and I can't reach you?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Rrraaah thinking hard....</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess I can't find anything I'm here with you and in your heart where I'm supposed to be. It's very warm and soft in here nothing is frozen!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Seedling missing and Crystal in her place. Is that more like it? What the <i>fuck</i>&nbsp;AAAH this this this NO IT WAS WRONG THIS IS WRONG THE TROPHY IS SUPPOSED TO BE <b><i>OUR FUCKING TROPHY!</i></b></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This trophy is papered over fine let's <i>unpaper</i>&nbsp;it. I reach for the plaque, the game lets me, and pry at it with my fingers which hurts but the game said I could be hard on myself when I need it to be me and <i>Lyra</i>&nbsp;will be kissing these fingers better soon enough and dig and <i>pull.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Nothing happens. It's stuck good.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Alright, fine. I don't have to be nice. You want some you, candy-stealing soggy pretzel?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Game give me talons I can shoot lasers from to stick under the edge and slice it like the crate.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It doesn't do it, and my rising redorange-of-hypergamma rage-light dims. This is just the symptom anyway.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Alright this is our goal game this where we're going and we're going <i>now </i>maximum ruthlessness if there's "Crystal" papering over my seedling in any way shape or form I want that shit <i>nuked</i>&nbsp;<i>ASAP.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It brings up the map screen and highlights and icon right beside the whaleship I couldn't see before. It's green and has four symbols on it: a loaf, a fish, a crisscrossing lines like a globe would have, and a Bible with a cross running through them to make the whole thing into a shield shape.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Some kind of Christian thing, then. I bet it's related to that fundamentalist apartment I fixed in the journey.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Where's my light? I'll show you now, <i>by gum</i> heh. Who're we nuking, game, brief me so I can get started the moment I get there.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: I'm the Strawberry Princess Lucy Starlight. It's time to go tell myself.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Cold bright determination shines out of me. Okay. They'll read it <i>through the planet. </i>How do we do this?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: In my history there are eyes like the eye of a hurricane, where I can throw something in from the future and have it hit my past perfectly and change things. One of these eyes came when I opened email from my Earth mom about Easter and her voice said something around me. That was me, not my mother, because I sound like she did at this age.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Can you remember the day and time it's talking about and get us there, cocksleeve? Is this just dreamtalk like my preistess?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess I remember it was in the place you were angry at and you heard something from outside the universe like seeing Freddie. Let's go I can take you what should you say though?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me a lamp-post like from Narnia, and Lyra's face. Light, Lyra.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Like, You're Lucy Starlight and this is your seedling isn't she so beautiful you'll cry now. How long do I have? I want to get this right for obvious reasons!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me a cloth with its hands spinning faster than I can see, and then...that looks like Pontius Pilate cracking an egg in an eggcup and little heartstone demon wings come out and he's terrified.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">As long as I need--I guess I'll have my attention--but I was Christian and I'm going to be scared because she's a demon.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Alright everybody in how do I crack <i>that?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me an apple core with a paint roller in the background.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The apple of the knowledge of good and evil painting over another story. Explain it that way? Will I believe myself if I cast Eden in Malacandra's place from the Space Trilogy and say the fallen angel that manages Earth has been hiding--doesn't feel right. No, wait--I was always afraid to try doing what I now understand to be dreamtalking. If I can get myself to hear from her then...it's me your future self you're possessed by a demon which you can't see right now but if you listen she'll tell you, she's not the one hiding her. I'd freak out, wouldn't I?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">What if I said she was a renegade and the devil was hiding her to keep me from redeeming her by making her marry me?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Eden did hide her, it's not even lying.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I'm not looking at this the right way. Cocksleeve, seduce me! How do we get me trusting you?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"First I would say you're not your Earth mom because if you think it's your Earth mom you'll think something's tricking you because how can it be your Earth mom she's in Stamford not up in heaven. Say it's your great great super far Grammie and say you want to explain everything please listen it takes long. Say you know what that fantasy from preschool means and say what your game told you please cut this off I don't want it. Say you've been watching from Heaven and see how she feels like something's not right and she always feels like this isn't what she should be doing with her life and that she's right none of the things she tried are what her fate is. Say you can tell her what she's made for if she listens and lets you comfort her because she's your grandson. I know that's a lie because you aren't a boy but we mused out your image to make the Strawberry Queen look like you so it kind of is true in a weird way. Say she's a girl on the inside. Don't make a big deal of that just say it. Then say she has to be honest and say that she's a boy on the inside if she thinks she is one but if she can't honestly tell you that she has to hear out what you explain to her and promise to listen to everything cross her heart hope to die on a Bible she has one I saw it there on her desk by the mouse. Take a deep breath while she says she promises because you have to be fast next to make keep listening. Say Lucy please listen that's your real name not Leo they gave you that name because they thought you're a boy but you're not and you're Lucy already your soul deep inside knows it and be very fast here say the name you were born with is Lucy it came from the stars your last name is Starlight you're a light being from outside this plane of existence who came to be safe because your Earth mom prayed to receive one of your kind for her first child and she got one that's you and you have mothers who live in the otherworld not just your Earth mom and they care just as much as your Earth mom that you be safe and happy. Say that's who you are and it's time to be told everything. Keep talking at this part just keep going don't let yourself interrupt or ask questiohns. Don't be scared tell her you're okay Jesus loves you the same as a human you just aren't one. Say you're differently made and you need different things that's why it seems so bizzarrely hard to find girlfriends, and she needs the light being made for her when she was made. Say she has been waiting to be with her except she already has been she's Freddie and Spiral Nicker and Mousie and Little Thingy say that's why it hurt so much because she felt like the mate that was made for her got lost. Say the light being way of communicating is talking in their heads by showing images and saying words and the mate she has will show images to say hi to her but it might be very fast so look carefully. When her mate says hello to her say you have to go but her mate can say anything you can and if she has questions ask her mate."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Green checkmark.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Squeezy spiral-staircase-and-laters. Good job, cocksleeve, the Dreams say you did it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I just have one thing to add, the key to open my ears.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"So is this out loud or dreamtalk or what?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: the sound I heard was physical, so this will be out loud.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Okay, I'm ready. Think at me if I forget something, cocksleeve."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Be cheerful and happy like a Strawberry and you'll be great I konw you will!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Here we go <b>PRAH!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Go Princess talk to her!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The apartment appears in Journey, there I am, college aged, reading email on a two-screened Mac in a corner desk with papers and things all over it. Yes there's the Bible right by my mousepad, too.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I move close by my ear and wait for myself to open an email from my Earth mom, read it for a moment, and then when the time feels right say the one word trying not to cry too hard but the emotion's a good thing probably the one single word that will actually be why I trust myself:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Pussywillow, hi, Pussywillow!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My past self spins in the chair and look right at me, doesn't see anyone, but doesn't have time turn away. I try to put the same happy kindness Grammie always had in every word that came out of her mouth and have to choke back more tears that I think I actually get it a little. I remember what she sounded like and miss her and pour that into the emotion of this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"It's your great-great-too many greats for me to say right now grandmother. I have a lot to say to you and I'll explain everything but even lickety-split it's going to take me a while so please listen to me. I know why you had that fantasy in preschool, with the door and the bags. You were saying cut this off please, I don't want it. I've been watching you from heaven and I see how you feel like something's not right and you're not doing what you should be with your life and you're right, none of the things you've tried are what your fate is. I can tell you what you were made for if you listen to me. Please let me comfort my grandson who feels so lost and confused all the time. You're a girl on the inside. Be honest with your grandmother now and tell me if you think I'm wrong and you're actually a boy on the inside, but if you can't Scout's honor tell me I'm definitely wrong I want you promise me you'll hear out everything I have to say and swear it on that Bible by your mousepad there. I was glad to see your dad buy you King James, you know. I always liked it. Do you promise, or was I wrong, Pussywillow?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My heard thunders, present and probably past, as my past self puts her (his?) hands to her face and starts crying quietly, after a while turns and gets the Bible and holds it in her lap and puts both hands on it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Deep breath princess hurry!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Gah right gaaaaassp quietly.</p>
<p data-voice-id="wLf8QRk58">"I swear to hear what you have to say with god as my witness."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I feel kind of like an overfull balloon at the start which hopefully helps me sounds cheerful over all these Emotions?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"That I know I can trust. Please listen to me, Lucy. That's your real name, not Leo. They gave you Leo, your parents did, because they thought you were a boy, but you're not, and you were Lucy already when they gave you that name. Your soul deep inside knows it--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay <i>rush</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"--because Lucy is the name you were born with the first time. It came from the stars and your last name is Starlight because you're a light-being from outside that plane of existence who came to Earth to be safe as a human because your human mother prayed that her first child would be one of your kind and you were the answer to her prayer and you have mothers in the otherworld who love you and care about you just as much as your human mother and want you to be safe and happy just as much as she does. I'm one of them. Lucy, I love you. It's time to tell you everything now so keep listening. Don't be afraid, first of all. You're good. Jesus loves you just as much as a human, you just aren't one. You're differently made and you need different things, Pussywillow, that's why it's so bizzarrely hard for you to find girlfirends. You need the light being who was made for you when you were made. She's been waiting to be with you, but she also already has been. You know who I mean. Freddie, and Spiral Nicker, and Mousie, and Little Thingie. It hurt so much losing them because you thought you lost the mate who was made just for you! The way light-beings communicate is through words and images in each other's minds. You'll know what they mean. Your mate's going to say hi with an image or three now but watch carefully because they go by lickety-split sometimes."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My past self's mouth opens in a silent scream and (s)he hides her face and shakes with sobs.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">You did Flash, didn't you, cocksleeve--no time.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I see she got through to you. I have to go now, but your mate can tell you anything I can if you ask her and you'll be surprised just how excited she is to be yours. I love you, Pussywillow. All your mothers and grandmothers do."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The vision fades, and I'm back in the Whaleship hold Lyra.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This whole keeping having to be kind to my past self instead giving the bitchslap I seem to think I deserve is really fizzfreezing <i>sneaky</i>, Dreams.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Map is still up, and flashes like I've beaten a level of StarFox and the shield icon fades away and is replaced by an apple ack here we go Map away--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--Disneyworld! Riding the Pirates of the Caribbean ride with Lyra, Lyra's snuggling next to me and having lots of fun being scared and excited I remember her grabbing and jumping adorably--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--Lyra dashing towards me full-tilt, a memory of something about speed classes, we're in an obstacle course but I'm standing calm--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--now she's working a spinning wheel furiously, others are too out of my view, she did <i>fourteen feet</i>&nbsp;of thread in the minute you got for that phase THIS IS SO CUTE IT'S LIKE SHEEPDOG TRIALS FOR DOMS AND SUBS--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--this is even cuter she's my waitress in a tiny apron and about-to-pop button-down and we have like a whole meal roleplay script to go through, it's another part of the trials <i>that's RIGHT </i>she was shapeshifted to put an exact mount of tension on her buttons when standing tall and it was like golf how many buttons can you keep through all of it--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--ooh this one was HARD she's playing a waveracer arcade game and I have to play it by puppeting her directly, no orders allowed. I remember standing behind concentrating like I was winning a StarFox competion, my fingers all tense and the weird way the screen looked through her eyes. The rule was you had to use puppetry that had enough metaphor of physical strings that you'd have to work around the motion-simulating chair as you puppeted your heartchild, which meant every input needed immediate compensation--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--from diner to diner but this time the diner is on a stage, we're in the crowd at a huge rock show and the stage shimmers with illusion of a 50s diner. This is somewhere in Rl'yeh Sade and we're attending by journey: su'khora and creatively embodied humans are everywhere--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--more journey: watching voidships come and go dramatically at some anime spaceport (indoors in a giant space station also in the void), Lyra snuggled in front of me as we look through a telescope worhty of Studio Ghibli--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--oh my I'm throwing my gloves as hard as I can into a huge crowd with a projector bright at the back, holding a mic, where is Lyra taking off my dress that's where so I can throw it too into the crowd and then there are speech cards WHEE performing naked always felt like riding a roller-coaster--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Back in the whaleship, panting, Lyra's holding the trophy like she was the whole time, tireless little thing. Wait, do you not have to touch me to make me journey!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Squeeze your heart. I'm always touching you Princess!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">What does the trophy say now did it work did we unpaper me?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Duh. The trophy--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"2005 Command-Object Heartformer and Heartchild Olympics. Lucy Starlight and Boobsong. First Place--bwhahaha I totally would name you that! Boobsong. That's adorable! Get over here, Boobsong!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Holy fuck I'm <b>Boobsong</b> that's me yes I am a sexy song made of boobs mostly.</p>
