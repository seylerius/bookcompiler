<article class="chapter 81---bleed-rainbows">
    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">81 - Bleed Rainbows</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I know who to ask about <i>this</i>. Idea, cocksleeve, how can tag be silly kinky fun with just the two--of--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"We're supposed to have <i>friends</i>. We <i>must.</i>"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My thoughts jam up, stuck on the empty place where life should be.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"AND WHERE IS OUR HONEYMOON!? I still don't know what episodes of Starlight Princess were actually like! And our private time like you said!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Tears overflow again as I understand this wasn't the last piece, it was just the one that ended the storms, because, because, all this whole terrifying ride was just to bring us <i>here</i>&nbsp;so I'd be able to fix my imagination enough to see the good in anything enough not to be terrified of everything. There was no way for it to be kinder, because I would have been just as scared of anything.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Just as I'm about to ask my special advisor her opinion the Dreams show me the Triforce frame from Zelda 1, three-quarters full of golden Triforce pieces.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: I'm now ready to start playing consciously. The game didn't tell me what was happening already because I couldn't have imagined how I could get through all this, let alone be happy to go through each part of it. Now that I can see this quest as a holy thing sacred to the joy the Dreams are made to guard for everyone who touches them, it's time to show me the Map.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Something comes over my vision like the Goals list, but it's oh my strawberry Arwing parts that's the sweetest kindest familiar thing this is StarFox's (the original, Super Nintendo version I'm Mistress of from my childhood) course screen! Icons lay out courses I can follow with lines joining them to show how I can move from one to the next. Here's the whaleship icon, moving toward Heart Home right where Cornernia would be in the lower left. Everything spreads out from there, including going back to Mama and Isht Visht which is one line leading to a picture of the camp connected to Heart Home. We have to go there first, apparently. Fine with me! Every other icon is greyed out and invisible yet I'm able to see where it should be, exactly how the places memories should be feel.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">With arms tight around Lyra to <i>say thank</i> you for this beautiful gift of <i>saving my overcaramelled life</i>&nbsp;I poke at the map screen. It looks like all of the icon-spaces are visible, though something makes it so I can't count or describe the ones I can't see yet. I wish it away and then back again, just like the goals screen, wonder if I can set--duh, just ask, right game? I can have everything from a goal marker like waypoints in the Waifu to "puppet me to the place I picked out so tight I don't even choose my own thoughts again till I get there", right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knolwedge: yes, and everything in between. I can even ask for a training montage where I sleep unless a significant moment is happening.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Bwhahahahaha--wait, like <i>literally</i>&nbsp;a training montage? Like could I ask to learn to paint and you'd give me paints and puppet me however long it takes to get the skills into me and I'd only be conscious for the training montage?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: I can learn subconscious skills like the physical part of using a paintbrush, but my conscious mind has to be awake for me to learn about composition and color theory, even using knowledge like this is (they would be very big and take many parts to integrate over hours and it would still be like reading about them instead of playing with color to see what happens). If the puppetry I ask for takes long enough to need to have sex with someone, the game will ask me ahead of time if I want to break out to decide how Lyra works into it, or say the game can make her fuck me when I need her, or anything in between again.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: I have the imagination now to understand the game isn't meant to take power away from me, it's meant to be convenient, and make all my decisions for me whenever I don't feel like making them. The game is a babysitter, not something to slowly turn me into a puppet. Babysitters do decide stuff without being asked to, because I don't always know when I need it, which is why I can't tell it not to take control when it's doing that. I can always ask for space if I want that, however! It will give me as much as it thinks is good for me. Right now I'm getting this whaleship to explore however I want to. It's like All Range Mode in StarFox CD. There's an icon on the Map that shows where my power is, the Arwing in the upper-left corner. If its wings are partly open like they are now, I can explore freely a limited space or set of things I can do. If they're fully open I have almost as much freedom as if I wasn't playing this game. If they're closed, it's like the hallway on Isht Visht where I was narrow but had agency within the thing I was thinking about. The Arwing may have tentacles hanging it like a model sometimes, but I will notice I'm a puppet in those times, to make sure I get the joy of feeling that powerlessness.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Cocksleeve."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess I'm ready--ooh aww hehe!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"This game is the <i>coolest. </i>Thank you."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess it was my honor making it. Please have fun with it! That's how you thank me for this."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Sparks and cumdollops, I think that musing really did something! A part of me that used to ring dead when she said stuff like that is singing so loud I can't keep a straight face as I talk:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Game, let's play Floor is Lava but it's Floor is Tentacles! If one of us falls in we both get tentacle raped until--until we're good and tentacle raped! And um...duh then I'm stuck naked until...idea, cocksleeve, how do I get clothes back?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess what if you have to find them or maybe not that particular outfit but like somewhere it should hide your license to wear clothing?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"YES! Game make it a real one the tentacles can steal from me if I get too close even if they don't get me, and full Floor is Lava rules like we can use cushions and blankets--bwaha and clothes to cross it and stuff! And decide if flying is allowed or sometimes or what and there has to be a safe spot around the bed where the presents are because I think I want to open them soon."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: any square of deck plating could have tentacles burst out if we step on it, but Lyra can tell which ones are safe to step on as long as I keep feeding her kisses to power the ability.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We're so going to get like five squares before we makeout our way to fucking right there, huh cocksleeve?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Bwaha YES I'll make sure you do!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: The clothing license is in my pocket now, and I have to keep it there as long as my dress is on me. If I take my dress off, I can stick it in the top of my stocking, but I can't keep holding it to keep tentacles from taking it. If I take my clothes off entirely, I forfeit it just like if tentacles steal it. I can get it back if I lose it, but the game can hide it anywhere, even not on this whaleship, so I might be stuck for a pretty long time if it gets taken.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Ooooh, <i>stakes. </i>Perfect, just how I wanted it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: If I get tentacle raped, the game will make me have sex with Lyra--I said she can be fucked, and the game's deciding to use my clit to fuck her with.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Bwahahaha squeezy--" <i>Slip? </i>Hey! What's wrong with <i>stripes?</i>&nbsp;That's not a very big word!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: I have to keep my swears creative as long as it takes my creative mind to get used to being able make them up at a moment's notice.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Flashing frilly bubblegum. This <i>rules</i> though!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Gentle tender strum to hear what my cocksleeve thinks of all this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess let's PLAY IT come on hurry I'm excited!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Kiss the top of your head for this cute enthusiasm.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Hell yes! Game how long before we get there? I want time to enjoy this!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: I get as long as it takes to explore the whaleship, and do everything we need to do before landing at Heart Home. Time-based advancement is boring so the game avoids it if possible. I can be sure in general the game will tell me with a timer when there is one. Otherwise, like a <i>good</i>&nbsp;videogame, I have as long as it takes to finish the level I'm playing.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Head up, cocksleeve!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Look up yay lifting me up to your head unf haaaah kiss mmmh...MMF RAAH KISS ME HARD? KISS YOU HARD!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I fiercely press my face against hers and push my tongue deep into her, and she turns her mouth into a hand gripping it to stroke it like a handjob, wonderfully like having my clit stroked--this tongue is <i>sensitive!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I love you too. You know me so well."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This is heaven. It really is. I don't know why that tiny detail makes my mind explode with the idea, but it does.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It <i>is</i> really thoughtful, cocksleeve.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">As I start to tell her to stand so I can get up too, a new vision comes over me like the others that've shown a lost piece of me, of houses, I think they were in Westchester County visit remote relations with my dad (and not my mom? Strange...) one day, or at least that's the memory they trigger--hey! I was playing Floor Is Lava with Lyra--OOH game when we find my friends we can play freeze-tag but you can actually freeze everyone--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: yes, and make sure It has special abilities that will make the game interesting, but I should really focus on the vision I'm having.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The vision feels terribly important like the others it's just <i>so good</i>&nbsp;to feel <i>life</i>&nbsp;pouring through what was dead minutes before this I can't help myself game please don't control it though I need it I didn't know what <i>being alive</i> felt like and I can't stop now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The vision pushes, and I <i>think </i>it's the same life pounding in me, actually. My wounds are starting to hurt because I'm awake enough to feel them. The pain made me scared before but now I want it because I feel alive with it, and I've just proven my imagination still works while I'm feeling it. As do the parts of me that are responding to Lyra...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now, what is this? I can't figure it out either unless it's just that like that was a traumatically boring trip or something silly. It had to do with my dad taking me to meet relations and my feeling not-identified with them or something? Argh. Idea, cocksleeve! Advisor-seer. Idea.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess maybe you felt bad because that family wasn't your family how Rada and Isht Visht are and you were looking for them or some people like them?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Good one, and good you noticed I love your voice--is it what you said...mmmmmaybe. Hmm.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The vision pushes harder and shows me their candy-bowl, all dried out and stuck together from being more of a centerpiece than source of pleasure (sacrilege! I the Candy Goddess smite you with floppy Twizzlers!) but I kind of liked the candy anway.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Frills of the trasheap-home dream surround it, making me feel like the most horrible snooty bitch princess who ever lived (anyway, their house was a lot nicer than ours was...).</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Also, why now, as I start to play Floor Is Tentacles and imagine the possibilities for kinky freeze tag?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: I'm playing the games I played before I had it explained to me I came from a family who kept dried out candy as a centerpiece instead of making up silly games and stories as a way to spend time with each other.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Stinky dried out merangue, it's right. WHY AM I SO HORRIBLE!? THEY WERE PERFECTLY NICE TO ME!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Here's what's really weird though: my whole family came on that trip, I'm certain of it, but I remember going with my dad alone.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Dreams, are these two different timelines? Can you tell me stuff like that? Can anyone?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Actually wait a minute, that whole <i>trip</i> was weird. We went in the 90s, but their house was like stepping back into 1955. The decor was preserved <i>perfectly</i>. Things looked new, even. It could have been a set off the Twilight Zone, which come to think of it it felt like.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I thought they were boring, but kind to me. I didn't think I took anything about that whole expedition to heart!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Wait, there was more than one trip! There's coming back from buying Zelda 1, remember that, cocksleeve? Okay this is a conflation jump and the weird is I've tangled the memories we need to go to all up but...what do we do here? I don't like the i-impli-cations of my family being able to traumatize me just by <i>who they are</i>. Idea, cocksleeve, you had the trail last time!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"It seems like you got confused because they aren't the same kind of being you are and your dad said everyone in the family came from the same bloodline so they must be like each other. He was always saying you reminded him of Grandfather with your engineering stuff, remember? What if your not being human entirely started to show and he thought it meant he was messing up as your dad because you were starting to seem alien?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Alright that's definitely a mistake he'd make and it doesn't make him secretly awful, so I think you're close anyway--yeah--RRR! What was my freakout when I saw our kids selves I said something."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The vision is pressing me so loudly it's hard to think. We need to go into the journey but I have no idea what to do there. I could ask the game or Dreams but I want Lyra's help first.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"You said imagining is pointless because people just take you out of your game the moment you get in it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I'm totally wrong, obviously, but like, <i>this</i>&nbsp;is definitely harshing my silly tentacle rape mood just as I get into it! This game's not even imaginary, I can feel my clothing license in my pocket between us! Fine fuck it game help I don't know what to do and it's getting hard to <i>breathe</i>."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: these are memories of times when I felt dragged back to Earth by the people around me. Grammie and Grampie were Strawberries, so I learned to find the missing sense of self I had lost in their company, and it made me vulnerable later when I believed in my heart the same thing was true of my dad's family. Every time I felt like Strawberry was only half of the truth about me I would look to his side, and get dragged down again by the Earthly family I saw there. My dad is their black sheep, remember, with his spirituality and mysticism of Christianity. Everybody else in that family was somebody who kept their living room the same for fifty years without changing so much as the candy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Whirling marshmallow airplanes, I'm a monster.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Not because it's mean to reject being part of my dad's family, because I can feel<i> </i>in my <i>bones</i> how it worked for Strawberry Queens. You don't have to be paranoid about anything but <i>maybe </i>STDs <i>if</i>&nbsp;they'd even been invented yet in that version of Earth, because it's easy enough to tell if the daughter of the Queen is her child, just get a couple of witnesses in the birthing room. They wouldn't have taken husbands the way patriarchal queens do, just had concubines they kept permanently because they liked them. You want to make a claim based on kinship to Strawberry riches? Good luck with that, the Queen's been with five men&nbsp;<i>this morning, </i>and they haven't even laid elevensies yet! The only constraint on who my father was would be that he had to be one of the strongest, wiliest men my mom could get her royal hands on. Rule naked indeed how <i>practical</i>. No wonder we're all such huge sluts! If we were even except I can kind of feel that, too, it's not just nectar making me hornier, it's nectar giving me a body that can keep up with my identity that's made me like this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">But it also means, I think, I'm bred not to identify much with my dad's side, just like I'm bred to somehow fit the shoes Mama took from my castle before I wrecked it--oh my holy undersweet club soda now I'm Cinderella on top of all the other ones who's even left at this point? Sleeping Beauty, got that, Cinderella I just said, Ariel I can be a mermaid anytime and I defintely want to leave the world I grew up in for a place I have to transform to live in and a lover who's another species to mine, Starlight Princess is just <i>me </i>and is technically a Disney princess however sad that made their accountants in the end, Jasmine yup I can wish for things and the Dreams are definitely wisecracking when I talk to them, who's left Snow White I did eat a very interesting apple but it sure wasn't poisoned...right Zelda now and Nintendo after all the is the Japanese Disney! Are we like, collecting, game? Holy strawberry pancake batter of the first Dynasty it just keeps <i>going </i>I'm blonde and snarky and I'd <i>like </i>to be mischevious if I can get over myself enough and I definitely keep on accidentally time travelling&nbsp;<i>hello my name is Marle and I'm a compulsive hoarder of princess identities</i>, Mama would defintely say I've had a way of being in another castle to a kind of silly extent, melting maple candycanes I even totally sent my faithful silvery servant to tell Mama she was my only hope!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Anyway. It'd be a lot simpler to just say my alien side was looking for answers and found the wrong ones in the place it was obvious to look...but then I'd feel more kinship <i>somewhere</i>&nbsp;for those people, and I never did even though they were kind souls and nice to me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This still isn't adding up and I'm flailing because it doesn't seem like enough to just go tell myself these weren't the droids I was looking for. I've already told myself I'm a light sorceress, do I just need to go do stuff like that again? Say I'm <i>my </i>family's black sheep? Game? Dreams? Advisor?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: where is my light now? Shouldn't I be really mad about what happened? Just because nobody meant it to doesn't mean it was right for my alien side and Strawberry heritage to both be eclipsed by this way of seeing myself! That took away Lyra from me just as much as anything else that kept me from seeing her. Why isn't that making me angry like last time?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Because Eden hit the perfect sweet spot of my mind understanding it was just cancer or a berzerk computer with my heart thinking it was a person I could punish for its crimes against us, unleashing the fury of revenge without any tempering guilt or empathy and with a big pile of righteous--hey! Who said anything about eclipsing!? I...oh. Had Strawberry grandparents but that was all of my connection to the other world I came from.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That thin thread was cut when Grammie gave up the house she'd lived in with Grampie in Florida to move to Connecticut (he'd died years ago). It was the right decision for her life, but...the queen without her "castle", to me just became my sweet grandmother exactly at the age I was getting old enough to start ignoring the things I felt from her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My parents might not want to remember but I can't just leave behind my Earth-mom knowing the spell to attract me in the first place. Did she throw that away on purpose, or did Eden take it from her? It had to be the second on in the history I remember here...okay now I'm mad a little bit but it just feels like my whole soul is buried in that concrete candy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Cocksleeve help me those princesses are an arsenal we <i>are</i>&nbsp;collecting but how do I use them I can feel this coming between us how long have I been sitting here thinking without even ogling you that's <i>wrong</i>&nbsp;it shouldn't be like that I should have vaporized half a universe already but I just feel...heavy...</p>
