    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">72 - BRB, Apotheosis</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i></i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cocksleeve, how long can we stay after past you and I leave?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Just a second or five Mommy it breaks really fast then.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Can you glitch through the shield or are we stuck in here?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Now that we came to this universe I can take us around it like we're walking and I can go through the shields if Isht Visht turns them off and right back on again quick while we're talking I bet we won't notice I don't remember that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">What happens if we're here when it breaks?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Nothing Mommy the journey ends and we go home again.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">When I check, past-Lyra is kneeling with the sword for past me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy get ready we're doing it!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The way I'm feeling makes it easy to remember the pure fury I forged into a weapon. The one I made then was a shape cut into the infinte brilliance of absolute rage, but I didn't understand light properly here, so I wrap the edgelord cloak I'm expecting around my knowledge of what I made and ready to push it at my other self as I draw the blade that isn't there yet--<i>push!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Dark purple fire fills the room.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Brilliant.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cocksleeve, Isht Visht, let's rock and roll. HURRY. We have about three minutes to found an entire mythology, are you guys with me?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">YEAH MOMMY I SEE WHAT YOU'RE THINKING THAT'S SUPER COOL LET'S GO!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><i>Sis I need you please hurry shield off and on again as we pass them Mommy I'm taking us out the window get ready for flying!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I know you are Mama, get ready because we're heh doing something very extreme now!</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd"><i>Boobsqueeze I'm very proud of you!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr"><i>I've got it sis you guys make this metal for Captain and me you hear me?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Head for window bwaha it's open naturally RRRAAAAAH CHARGE!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Wings open FLAP! Hey they make no sound, cool!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Make it metal yourselves or do you not want there to be kinky pirates and horny water sprites? Mama they won't speak English here, right? Even though it's weird with names apparently?</i><br></p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr"><i>Lucy I've got this we studied this place for twenty-seven thousand years remember. Let me make a piece of gum and you can chew me and I'll share the language with you!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">OH MY FUCKING GOD GAME THAT REWARD HAD BETTER LIVE UP!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Mama can she do that and still be whatever you need from her for this?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd"><i>She can and she will give her a kiss and get moving we're jumping off next!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr"><i>You'll decloak when I jump off Lyra so be ready to impress, girl!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>GAH I STILL HAVE MY CURLERS ON!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: my hair has been ready for a while, so my game took them out and stored them for Rada. I can be sure the game won't let me do something like this unless I'm presentable.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">We're out in open air now, and Lyra's just flapping higher--good cocksleeve. Isht Visht leaps up to kiss me and presses something into my mouth--HAH of course it's saltwater taffy. She and Mama let themselves slide off Lyra and I feel the weird conflict of their still being their back in the living room while here they've leapt off. I'm glad for the phantom of Mama's arms holding me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">It's a brightly moonlit night, with a huge moon in the sky, and below us as I watch our bodies fade back into being with Isht Visht gone, and though I almost expect to see a raging battle the castle is quiet.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">To my surprise, I'm not shining already. Game are you holding me back somehow?<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: this time is different. I've decided ahead of time how to channel my anger to create something kind and beautiful, and that gives me the strength to hold back my light until it's time for it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Well good, because all I'm thinking right now is <i>how dare they be sleeping.</i>&nbsp;Cocksleeve, fly over the courtyard.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">As she wheels, my mouth falls open, because of course Isht Visht didn't show the scale of the other ones, and the one I got was a tiny toy. There, in the center of the courtyard a good five hundred feet tall with its silver-and-purple vine and bas-relief strawberries--but no&nbsp;<i>text--</i>all over its four sloping white marble sides and pointed top shining metallic at the tip...</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">...is monolith zero.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">And it really sticks out as some kind of time-travel thing, because as pretty as the castle is there's no way they built this with the medieval tech that's all around us. The top is almost level with Lyra and me. It looks out of place, weirdly familiar...especially against what I saw in Limbo and called a "segment of the Berlin Wall" at holy fucking <i>shit </i>this really is home what did my family turn our back retaining wall into in Limbo but <i>the curtain wall of our old castle!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Game or guardian I need that trumpet of the apocalypse--no. No I don't. Cocksleeve, turn into a big scary-cute and extremely sexy dragon--um, don't knock our house down--and while you do it think about how somewhere in this castle is the person whose inability to even <i>try </i>to imagine a better world brought us to <i>Earth.</i>&nbsp;If any <i>person</i>&nbsp;is responsible for what we've been through, it's them. Get yourself good and on that page and then<i>&nbsp;wake their ass up and get them out here so I can yell at them. </i>I'll get off you then but you'll still be leashed--be sure show them your loyal submission when I start talking!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Holy fuck I'm so FURIOUS that page is made of angry RRRAAAAAAAAA</p>

<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">She transforms like last time, but this time there are shining-silver armor plates along her body that catch the moonlight gorgeously. I hope the people below can truly see us and not just with clairvoyance, because she is <i>epic.</i></p>

<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">This next part's a little scary. I leap from Lyra's back--<i>more leash in the journey or something I guess eravahk--</i>smash--agh watch my antennas--smash my crown on my head I guess this will work as a coronoation--watch leash spool out in front of me and slam my wings open cranked to full brightness flap myself to a halt to come up beside Lyra just a bit higher than her head inhale the few air molecules Lyra left and bellow with all my floor-smashing voice power:</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">«<b>HEAR ME!</b>»</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I don't even have to mean to, with Isht Visht's--<i>Isht Visht</i> in my mouth it just comes out in the local language. Her voice is soft in my ear telling me the words to say so I say them without thinking about it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="FCmxrIh5N">Face submissive eyes down look at you Mommy like I love you that's because I do everyone this is my Mommy listen to her or I will roar at you a second time-a!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Oh my god cocksleeve I love you so much. The grin this brings to my face is <i>perfect</i>.</p>

<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">When I look down, the airship from Final Fantasy III is moving into position by the castle very...piratically. Nice, Isht Visht. I hope you're giving Mama some beauty shots down there--alright Mama's on this. A grappling hook pierces an unseen part of the castle wall, and Mama ziplines along its cable bristling with <i>equipment</i>&nbsp;like I'd always imagined Link would look in real life if--wait, Isht Visht is green--nah--it's sort of a fun thought, though--focus, Princess.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Now, if I eat that entire moon I'll have enough cheese for what I need to do here. There will be some taking credit for things I didn't do but let's just see how far the Dreams and my game let me take this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">They're kind. They won't let me underdo it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="FCmxrIh5N">Mommy look down below they're coming out to see who was roaring!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Below us, people are streaming onto the battlements as well as the courtyard carrying heavy-duty crossbow-looking things and other siege weapons. What will that even do to us, this way--who cares HOW DARE THEY!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">This time I whip up the fury on purpose.&nbsp;Some ancient part of me must remember the spreading blood thrones are built on wake up princess your subjects are getting uppity!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Light erupts, and night turns into day so that the sky turns blue.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cocksleeve, IR laser every piece of military hardware you can see. Try not to burn them, but everyone down there is now a civilian, get me?</p>
<p data-voice-id="FCmxrIh5N">Tail up spread out into lots of them rrraaaah LASER! ONE-BITS ON FULL BLAST FOR SHIP TO SHIP COMMLINK THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">A heartbeat of nothing passes as bolts nock and cranks turn and then there's a commotion of steel being thrown down--holy fuck here are the hot steel--and weapons run from.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cocklsleeve, anything military and unattended becomes vapor.</p>
<p data-voice-id="FCmxrIh5N">AAAAH FRY STUPID WEAPONS!!! YOU WRECKED MOMMY'S WHOLE LIFE WITH THESE YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM!!!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">They're terrified. Half the people kneel in supplication while the others stand and stare like the ponies from that scene with Pinkie and...somehow, my anger and light stay undimmed, but some kind of wet soft sob chokes the <i>wrath </i>I was going to open with.

<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Our church could have been something our of The Princess Bride complete with a stone pulpit on a good ten feet of pillars, but he wouldn't use it.

<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I forget I'm not speaking English for the pun, but Isht Visht is the mistress of puns like I am StarFox.

Be nice. Make everyone envious!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: Earth had no magic because Eden bound it into chains of math as a last resort to stop its death. This world would seethe with it, if anyone dared to imagine.

In this depths of this castle, your queen flees to the greatest achievement this world has yet dared, haunted by ghosts of intruigue and betrayal, sleeping in finest silk and yet never free of the scent of the blood which spreads under every throne now and which she knows one day soon must be hers.»&nbsp;</p>

<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">«That achievement might have been this world's salvation by its own hands. Instead, it will be its doom. There is a door through which she and the last heir of the Strawberry Dynasty will flee to a world other than this--another sphere under other stars where even the gods are different. In the lock of that door is an infinite key which may turn the door open on anyplace imaginable. If she commanded, and the court wizards who crafted it but dared, they would be able to open it on the paradise from which I have come and walk without passing through death into the arms of their ancestors and eat the fruits of paradise--and all of you would be able to follow!»<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Dreams, right? Once the door's open on you you keep it open?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Green checkmark.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">«Instead, they open it on a world no different than this, where the winters are colder and the wars more terrible, because they upon whom&nbsp;<i>your riches</i>&nbsp;were heaped that they might better dare and imagine for all your good could see no world better than this. Even I can neither stop nor save her, but it is not given, especially to queens, to hold the key to paradise and stand before the door and fail to turn the lock, and so in justice for this, the very sky shall become the door that was denied to you!»<br></p>

<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes Mommy you got stolen out of your castle by a big scary dragon kidnapping you RAAAAAH!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I love you so much.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Yes, and now she's <i>got me</i>!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">&nbsp;I fuzz her mane, then smack her flank affectionately.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">I love you too Mommy!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"So Isht Visht this is awesomely kinky but like, would you like your piece of you back now?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Nah, you can keep it. I'm pulling out of it though so it's just candy now."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The flavor and texture of Isht Visht's taffy change, only slightly, but enough to feel like she's unplugging the headphones I'm wearing, leaving just a piece of delicous, sea-breeze-and-lilies saltwater taffy. I gnaw on it happily and it starts to disintegrate like the real...thing...cocksleeve. Where should your bubblegum fruit grow from? Where on your body, you can make candy fruit I can pick off you and eat right? That's why you have candy inside you?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I'm not into knife-and-fork cannibalism that I can tell but...somehow this way is a million times more kinky to me, and awesomely appealing.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">OH MY FUCK THAT'S AMAZING um I think on my tail would be sexy just like the Rider Waite-Smith Devil card she has a tail like that or maybe my earlobes I could have bubble gum earrings imagine how sexy it would be to make out and nibble my earlobe and actually bite a piece off of me and have me still pretty with earlobes you can bite and it looks like I have earrings when they're ripe Mommy let's try it please have me shapeshift them!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Oh my fuck yes. The minute you're back to girl-form, and make them you-flavored and shaped like grape bubbleyum with the two-tone thing you know what I mean you were there.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy yes I can see you that's awesome that will even make good jewelry for me that's definitely my style!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">HELL YES. Oh my god it is that so suits you this is so inspiring.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The last of Isht Visht's candy is dissolving, yummy to the end, but even while the flavor makes me smile its subtlety raises my hunger for a mouthful of Lyra's sweet intensity.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Thanks, Isht Visht, for everything. That <i>ruled.</i>"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"The one who should be thanking anybody is me. Captain implanted me in the first place because she wanted to sail with a water sprite like in the Strawberry Dynasty stories! If you hadn't said that thing about pirates and water spirtes, I might not even be here! Thank you guys from the bottom of my heart."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"You dove into that egg with me, almost got burned, you watched you poor Captain die in my arms, like...I dunno...I mean you guys almost literally at a few points dove into a star to bring me my crown...what you did was <i>hard...</i>you're welcome but I don't feel like I <i>did</i> anything not really I've been riding this ride this whole time! Even my own poor seedling keeps having to get up and save me yes I know you don't mind cocksleeve that's not my point here."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Whatever speechifying magic was just powering me seems to be gone.</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"I watched you set fire to an entire solar system because you found out it was trying to fuck with your relationship with Lyra, and I was there when you were stabbing Earth out, and then I was translating the speech you gave just now. Isn't for Fairies the hardest thing controlling yourself? Every time you explode you're more powerful and terrifying and BIGGER except instead of destroyng everything this time you directed it, I watched you, I saw you turn that light of yours on and off like a lightswitch. Just because we keep saving you doesn't mean you're not doing anything, Princess, and it doesn't especially not for your Fairy ass mean you aren't doing what's hardest for you for the sake of your family. That's why I'm saying thank you."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">That same falling feeling as in the cockpit of the Waifu, because she's so right, this control is what was hard for me and I'm still not sure how I managed any of it--hey! The Waifu's laser pods are blue, that isn't right! Game I need to change them soon. I need to make that thing really look like a Princess' chariot.</p>
<p data-voice-id="v5MELBxAO"><i>Top, Change the paint on your chariot to match your true colors, Half-moon rainbow lightningbolt</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Okay I can already tell from that and the one episode I've that there's a Rainbow Dash out there like there like there's a Guinan and Beverly and Deanna and we're going to race and it's going to <i>fucking rule.</i>&nbsp;Good one game.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I still can't believe I managed to do any of that stuff. My game <i>must</i>&nbsp;have been driving or setting me up or <i>something </i>but it says it's not which is really fucking confusing honestly because like, you've met me, I have the social graces of a burnt-out toaster oven! I can only assume that's not what you guys like me for, but like, if I believe what happened, I just Picarded up an entire mythology of awesome porn! I'm just not that <i>good</i>, I mean I never had friends in school and everyone made fun of me and...you get the idea. Dammit Jim I'm a computer nerd, not a rockstar."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"And for that matter how <i>did </i>I control myself like that? Everything I've been learning is teaching me how I'm just fire that burns in its container and I can't control it and that's okay and then I get up there and do <i>that</i>&nbsp;and...everyone what the hell? What even was that?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"I think that was love, Lucy. You did that for Captain, and maybe I'm just being romantic, but it seems to me that like, you being a Fairy doesn't mean you can't love people, and there has to be some ability for you to express your love that isn't just grabbing for them even if that is the main way you express it, and in that speech you hauled close on that for Captain's sake, and you know anger's a powerful thing and I bet it helped you when you figured out you can direct it into making yourself sharper. As for your social graces, Lucy Princess they aren't the same thing for a ruling-class family in a feudal empire as they are in fucking Earth high school in the 90s! You did fine as a Princess telling her subjects to shut up and listen she's talking now! Maybe that's what you're made for. You're the last in a long line of queens after all! So what if that's Monstrous, you read the Five Pointed Star to her right sis?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes! As soon as it was possible I made her read me a story and the story was the Five Pointed Star."</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"So you understand. Just have fun with it! Go to a party and get fun times happening by commanding it! The Princess of Strawberries is here, bow and be blessed with an orgasm! People who like that stuff are drawn the Strawberry Dynasty because it excites them! Just imagine what you can do with that!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">My voice is kind of wavery and I feel a kind of fainting terror and something I can't quite remember from Colleen's brother's house that isn't lingering trauma, but...I can see the shape of my soul now in what I just did and yes I am a monster and yes it is terrifying, but I <i>refuse</i>&nbsp;to take this all seriously:</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Minus one. If I am ever the evil--no. If I am ever the <i>sexy</i>&nbsp;overlord in a fantasy story, I will notice that I'm the sexy overlord in a fantasy story as soon as monstrously possible."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cocksleeve--no, I want her to do it from my feet. It'll mean no longer snuggling Isht Visht--until the next time she gets even the slightest excuse, I can see now--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">There's a sudden explosion with the sound of a noisemaker like you would get at a party thrown in for good measure, and confetti and tape like parades have explodes through the Friendship is Magic screen and covers the room in a party--that's the only way to describe this. This magic is made to decorate places, it seems like, because our living room is now pink-and-white streamers and strawberries on napkins and plates and the table cloth I can see past the TV screen and banners and <i>everything</i>. The plates are all real and the table cloth looks silky-expensive and everything looks fit for a princess which makes sense since I am one but what new fun toy is this now?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I would have realized I was trans a lot sooner, it occurs to me as I check out the suddenly-pink room, if I'd known being a princess would be so <i>fucking metal.</i></p>
