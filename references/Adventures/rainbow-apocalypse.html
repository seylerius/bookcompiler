    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">76 - Rainbow Apocalypse</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">&nbsp;I twist us around, trying to see visually what the sensors missed, but we're alone in a huge expanse with only some rocks far in the distance, hazy even in the Sea's clarity.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cocksleeve go do however much sensor sweep you can without blowing our cover. Think weird for obvious reasons--would it be possible for one of Isht Visht's parallel-universe sails to hit us maybe?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Hugs squeeze off down to consoles. Sensor sweep passively everywhere...</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Dreams why won't you answer me?<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">This at least gets a fat green joint so big it has to be tied with string, and a dancing mushroom of the kind you get on acid rock album covers, and then a drawing that could be a cross-section of Arwing fuselage.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Drugs, hallucinations, the fuselage...Dreams are you telling me that didn't actually happen?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">A bundle of sticks with one end on fire? Cocksleeve, pause your sensor sweep, what is this?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy that's purifying incense and the first thing wasn't a joint it was sage leaves. The first vision means purify by taking a trip in--Mommy I get it where can this Arwing take you into our past to conflate with it?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">That would...it'd be like going back to make a time-loop, wouldn't it, except just reliving the memory like it was the first time, right? You think it could change our storybraid?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">No my face super intense up to you see I say YES!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">It'd have to be after we got it...I mean we have yet to have a flight that isn't an emotional wringer but this is the first traumatic one, and why would we need to go back to our journey since it showed up? Cocksleeve you're onto something be smart what do you see?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Rrraaaah thinking smart clean up by a trip like a journey by conflation in Arwing you played that game every day twice to become the Mistress of StarFox won the jacket dad was proud painful times at the church a lot maybe that could be you wanted an Arwing that's why I made you this....rrrah think stupid cocksleeve where is conflation jump it must be celebrity there wasn't one moment Mommy see this I'm thinking right it's got to be from your thirteen year old time--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I see and I get it get up here I need you to think the Dreams whacked us I'm satisfied with that okay every time we've done something like that it's gone horribly right I was pissed at my commbadge and I blew up a ringworld and yes it was fucking cathartic, I was hurting about Freddie and we fixed that and I'm seriously different now I can see the like fold in my timeline where I got way more fun but then we stabbed out Earth and <i>that </i>was cathartic though I didn't feel much different and then&nbsp;did the castle thing and you commissioned Mama and stuff changed and you'd think the castle thing would have woken something up in me but whatver it woke is all messed up and I super want to die now all of our stuff like that somehow went horribly right and I can't say the castle <i>didn't</i>&nbsp;but the resutls aren't the same what the fuck why is this not like the other times."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Eee you're waking up a bit poing to your lap very snuggly soft hi look up see me your cocksleeve is ready raaah.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">A weird conflict is bubbling up in me, I can't shake my despair but on a completely different axis I'm annoyed and want heaven to get back to being heaven already and am willing to break some history books to make it happen if that's what it takes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Pikachu, Dreams? Gotta catch 'em all! Catch what all, traumatic moments in my past? Memories? What do you think Cocksleeve?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">I think it's all of them, that makes sense because when we do these conflation things we get lots of memories that make us feel whole again. We just have to find out how to catch what you lost with celebrity!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Holy shit.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cocksleeve, I'm <i>already back</i>. What was in that box? We <i>knew,</i>&nbsp;cocksleeve. That box followed Colleen and me through the worldgate it's not like we could say 'what a coincidence you look just like Princess Lucy and Melody'.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">EDEN'S GODDAMN HISTORY CHANGING YEAH MY FAMILY HAS A WHOLE EARTH HISTORY <i>NOW!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Game what were you trying to show me? Was it something about the fact that we knew we were Lucy and Melody while we were on Earth?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cocksleeve oh my god. Remember goo-ing into that vending machine for me? You could see the reflection through my eyes, right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy that's right I remember there was a person with lots of huge cameras! They were watching us not just a tourist to take pictures of the weird luxhi'khora getting candy out of vending machine because her heartformer did so fairly pay for it!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Suddenly the pain inside me is sharper, more focused, has become the pain of a missing limb but it's memories. It wasn't weird to take pictures of Lyra's antics...but isn't taking pictures of a couple of kids&nbsp;who aren't yours with a huge telephoto lens which is what I saw in the glass as she pressed against it pretty creepy in any timeline? Especially since Lyra couldn't bring her clothes in there with her--we'd thought we were alone I think, and the vending machine was quite obscured&nbsp;<i>and I was up against it to hide her that's right!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I'm pretty sure I can remember learning fast most paparazzi will happily sell child porn if it's a scoop. The hate is there, anyway. Something. I don't have the <i>context </i>for the feelings.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Furious, I wheel the <i>Waifu </i>around like I can find the problem and stuff a novabomb up its nose right this moment.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Okay game for real I'm done PMSing what were you trying to show me?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: I'm immune to PMS because I don't have a uterus and nectar will balance my hormones. If I ask for the order it would have given me as we launched before I'll find out how to deal with this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cocksleeve I have no idea what this is going to do, hang onto your ass!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes you woke up finally Mommy my heroine! Do it I'm ready I'll take anything just be awake with me!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Weepy from her sweetness, I grab the controls like I'm hearing those mumbly voices that soon become "EMERGENCY, EMERGENCY". Give it, game.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The game fucks my mind good and wide but with gentleness, and it comes into focus that the StarFox Super Weekend was a publicity stunt that Nintendo gave to market their game StarFox. I cling to the title Mistress of StarFox like it means something, but it was just a usenet sigline I used for a while and forgot about. If Lucy Princess of Strawberries was known to be on Earth and famous enough to have paparazzi at rest stops in the middle of nowhere, what would Nintendo have done when they found out she was obsessed with their new game StarFox? Especially when she turned out to be really good at it? They would have made her title official, and made a celebrity endorsement deal.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Out of the depths up in front of us a gate like the ones on Corneria that hides the twin blaster if you fly through the arches appears.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I steer towards it, swap to the SNES controller. It's closed, but I'll blast it open at the right moment. Game, strap us in. Cocksleeve, you know what to do here, right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Tentacles slither around us and make a harness holding Lyra to my lap facing out so I'm using the controller pleasantly against <i>her </i>tighs, and snug us down tight to the seat. It's nice to feel held and contained like this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy yes I'm conflation-jumping us into the StarFox Super Weekend run where you got the high score for all of New England.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Yes, but remember history is different--wait seriously? Nintendo tapped not just a porn star but a literally porn <i>goddess</i>&nbsp;in everyone's eyes to be their spokeskid for StarFox? In the era where you couldn't say <i>dead</i>&nbsp;in Final Fantasy? Wait gah how does that even work we had to keep that box shut till I was old enough but there's no way someone didn't tell us as soon as they could just for the news story! What the fuck was my upbringing!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: history changed a lot with the change that made the past I remember. Luxhi'khora were a destiny anyway. My having Lyra around me told the truth more than any books or mythology could no matter who I was. Nintendo was smart enough to reach out to them as a big demographic with powerful friends--namely seed-ghosts--in the otherworld. I was my game's charge very early in that world, and it was as scary there as it has been here. These were powerful beings states and religions had to bend around, not little children with silver hair.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">What the fuck kind of world are we going to!? Here's the gate, give me StarFox cam, game!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">My viewpoint slides out through the Waifu's rear, and I hammer Y just in time to open the gate onto Corneria.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><b>PRAH!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Reality shifts as we pass through the gate, becomes dual and then the real world fades but the gate is one, is the doorway to Cornernia, the shortened one with the timer counting down in the upper right.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">As soon as the first hits of synthesized guitar thud up my spine ruthless furious reflex takes over and my thumb covers X and Y at once and doesn't stop hammering. This was the first secret: factor out even thinking about acceleration and firing. You're always doing both, make it automatic. The very frame the boost guage fills it's spent another acceleration, and you fill the sky with laserbolts no matter if there's anything for them to hit. That way, you can concentrate on flying the whole stage on accelerators which is stressful but fully doubles the possible score in the time limit. Then it's just a matter of those swooping arcs of fire that clear the sky in one smooth motion, and knowing the five optimal places to use novabombs to save time in the bossfights...</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">As my subconsicous mind transforms into the long-practiced engine of polygonal destruction I start to notice my surroundings, and self--I'm a girl, I think that same awkard teenager wearing a dress of some kind and maybe stockings it feels like yeah my hips have that cool bare feeling you get from skirts that makes pants feel choky--though I daren't look away from the screen for even half a frame. Instead of standing at entrance to KayBee at the mall I'm sitting in some kind of fancy chair, prim with the stress of playing, a little silver doll in my lap clings to my wrists excitedly, watching me conquer, and we're in some kind of palatial room, and--oh my god. Mama did you know you got <i>these </i>speakers to show me Friendship is Magic on? The screen is a massive projector screen, no impossible hologram but still HUGE in 1993.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Hair falls in my face as I play, leaning forward intensely, my face hard, as the attack carrier slides into view and I unleash my secret weapon on it, growling aloud with the effort, hammering laserbolts into it, and suddenly as it goes down in mere seconds I realize how much better I'm doing. I was always <i>good</i>. I won the New England region, which got me my jacket...I think this might not be that stage of the competition. I was always <i>good</i>&nbsp;at this game, but in this memory or journey or whatever it is I'm <i>terrifying. </i>I lean forward and rise off the chair snarling with the exertion as three successive uses of my secret weapon without a rest in between tears the Attack Carrier from the sky and stand for the next stage, hold Lyra one-handed to brush my hair back in between stages--holy fuck, I'm wearing my jacket. This isn't a fancier version of KayBee because I'm a princess. Clutching Lyra to my stomach, I unleash new constantly-barrel-rolling fury on the Asteroid Field. Not rock goes untouched, no novabomb missed, every fighter bursts to pixels almost the very frame it appears.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Dammit I can't remember did I look at the score while I was playing it's there but the concentration this takes is <i>intense</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Three perfectly-placed novabombs crush the rock crusher in the first frame each weak point is vulnerable, and with a perfect 100% on the asteroid field (naturally) it's off to the bonus stage.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I glance down at Lyra, see my long strawberry hair against my jacket, check my score as the stage transition runs.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The first digit is a <i>three</i>. Is three hundred thousand even <i>possible</i>, with absolutely perfect play? 381,264. <i>Before the bonus stage. </i>The bonus stage is worth over a hundred thousand if you play right and still have some novabombs and get there with more than thirty seconds left. Yes I'm definitely wearing a pretty dress under my jacket because I swish and swirl it with victorious glee in the interstage. That's right, I was all got up as a fancy goth princess with her demon dolly!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">What's on my head inside my crown oh right the Fox ears hehe!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I swoop into the bonus stage with <i>a minute twenty-three</i> on the clock. Eighty-three whole seconds. I'll break half a million with that!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Which is exactly what I do. In the memory I stand agape just as much as in the journey, looking at Slippy holding my final score:</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">542,912</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">For a moment I stand panting, then I march up to the screen, give slippy a kiss just in case he's a cursed prince and only my true princess' kiss can restore him, turn to smile for the camera a moment and then--thiiiiiiis isn't a house.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I can't really see the crowd beyond the lights--is that Shigeru himself hanging out by the side of the stage with a cigarette? I force myself to face the crowd instead of fangirling, Lyra still clutched in my arms, lights in my face. The crowd is applauding sincerely but it doesn't have the rodeo chaos of an American crowd always on the edge of riot because, of course, we're in Toyko, where else would we be? Even for Lucy Princess of Strawberries you won't fill auditorium like this for a StarFox competition in the states.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I give a big bow, catch my crown from slipping off my head--just a reproduction, the real one is lost in some random world or blown up by the dragon that we totally didn't need to run from except for the everything else tearing the empire apart when we left--and when I straighten flash to some kind of back hallway squeezing past TV cameras and crew who back against the wall to let me pass unimpeded.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Donuts, zillions, Lyra still tiny clutched in an arm while I devour some in the narrowness of the green room. Shigeru walks all silly, punching the ceiling tiles and making Mario brick-break sounds, slips past, starts talking about something or another but I'm still kind of in StarFox trance I think and OH MY GOD ITS SHIGERYU MIYAMOTO except in the memory this is much less of an event than that. Others are here too but all I know is donuts and that I should technically be having a fangirl heart attack but aren't.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Shigeryu is sitting down? Cameraman. Hi Camera! Chairs, it's one of those totally staged INTIMATE BACK ROOM INTERVIEW EXCLUSIVES and I'm plopping happily in my chair opposite him, it's a big fancy princessy curved one (omigod Mama did you somehow find <i>this chair </i>for your nursery) while everyone else has normal chairs (my game was already picky at that point) and the interview is starting and there's a big foam mic and huge TV camera and lights all crammed in this tiny corner and I should be terrified but it's like the castle this is awesome all this attention RULES come on ask me something so I can sound smart I already know I look pretty.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cigarettes? No thanks--wait, the fuck!? I'm thirteen! No, I remember, heartformers get out of all that once their seedlings have nectar, I could smoke the whole case with no ill effects and the addiction reset in two hours unless it's somehow a part of my identity. (And if smoking <i>were</i> part of my identity, in a way that affected my heartforming which is to say <i style="">yes</i>, nations would fall trying to keep me from lighting up, and that's even just our seed-ghost&nbsp;<i>without </i>my game) Shigeryu lights up. Dude smokes like an entire industrial revolution, this is not in his PR image but we're in the green room, that stuff is suspended here.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cookies now, random fruit ones on a red plastic plate. Plastic cups of like water, someone has beer but not me beer is too boring especially after tasting Lyra's nectar, we're in a Kareoke parlor and it feels late but that might just be wanting to go fuck Lyra who I remember being especially shiny that night. Shigeryu is there, reclining in the corner, still smoking, it's like his 800th cigarette of the night or something. Someone else is with us but between fangirling Shigeryu and ogling Lyra I like never look at them. Lyra's so shiny because she's big and making us all cry with her orchestral-techno kareoke. We already have the leash, I can see it leading to her neck from my hand as she sings the <i>fuck</i>&nbsp;no it's 4am in Tokyo in the early 90s this place makes New York City look like Pleasantville nobody even gave the leash a second look.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Milk on a table, we're back in a fancy hotel room I think, the sun is up and I've been having cereal. Lyra's on the table feeding me--the game suspended my rules for the donuts or something, or yeah exceptions when Lyra just can't physically fit to do things for me which was true in that weird broom closet of a green room. Here in the hotel she can kneel on the table and feed me cereal and hold up the bowl for me to drink up the milk as I thrum with the energy of a teenager who's gotten to stay up all night--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The vision breaks and we're flying through a ring out of Polygonal Corneria and into the True Sea again.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">EEEEEEEEEEEEE That was the coolest remember the look on Shigeryu's face when you made me big and I sang him the Zelda theme? That was the <b>best </b>I MADE SHIGERYU MIAMOTO CRY HAH! Mommy let's do another one what else are you missing does celebrity feel bad to you still?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I blink, trying to process--here we gooo--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--a picture of a tractor on TV, <i>our </i>tractor, it's a news report about the princess on the farm--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--a cartoon talking hammer on TV, blobby with shapeshifting, a kids' cartoon starring a luxhi'khora with a tool archetype, beloved because the main characters reminded me of Lyra and I--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--looking down at Lyra walking along the reddish-sparkly sidewalk, no, I remember the planks for the new concrete and the silver can of sealant or whatever off to the side they used to glue the star down WHaT THe FUcK!?--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--bent over a black mirror at Caroljeanne's house struggling with my concentration to make my pink writing form and clarify the pale-green-cursive-ish writing from my otherworld partner--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--my Earth-mom making breakfast in an unfamaliar house, Lyra carrying the huge model Arwing she and Isht Visht made me for my birthday--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--going somewhere in a limo, people are at the windows with cameras--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">More blinking and holding Lyra.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Cocksleeve?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy you're the strawberry princess Lucy and I'm Melody of course we got stars!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">SHOW ME MORE DREAMS WHERE IS IT I WANT MY FUCKING PAST BACK!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">A Cyborg from Marathon Infinity?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Marathon! Marathon came after StarFox! Why <i>was </i>that lightswitch--a Marathon lightswitch with the huge indicator light, belonging so seamlessly I didn't even register that it wasn't a normal lightswitch--so high up by the ceiling out of reach?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Now the question is, am I going to hit it with a grenade from the literal bigger gun that was totally nearby under the pool toys, see what happens if I hit it with a novabomb, or fly up there on my Fairy wings and punch it like a proper vidmaster? Vidmistress.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I'm going to do the one where I'm a pretty Fairy princess who's full of the fury I showed the StarFox Super Weekend final (that's right, I was beside my opponent, who had his own set done up in glowy 90s scifi beside my princess parlor, I can remember the diagonal texture on half of his chair-back, I can't quite remember if Shigeryu said he'd <i>seen </i>and been inspired by The Wizard or just thinking he must have been), and fly up there and <i>punch every switch</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Right, cocksleeve? Do you remember?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy I know that switch is interesting but not what it does.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Let's go see. I swing the Waifu to line up with the course I set before and peg the throttle forward--hey, if we're phased we won't make shockwaves! I can fly this stage on constant accelerators too! Yah!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Acceleration presses Lyra wonderfully into me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">WWHHEEEEE your breasts in my wings feel so sexy!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">How was I <i>that</i>&nbsp;good? I practiced, this big guy in a suit with a red tie keeps presenting himself to my memory. My coach? RRRR it's all so <i>fragmentary! </i>I daren't press, I can feel conf--confab-u-lation opening out like an abyss of lies waiting for me to sit there <i>trying</i> to remember.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">For the same reason, all questions of just how the fuck it worked that at the age of TEN Lyra and I got <i>walk of fame stars </i>for the porn empire we would found--was that <i>why </i>it feels like maybe there was something else or something--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The tunnel of guide rectangles is bending right, here's the hangar. Game, let Lyra go so she can get us ready to land--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Slabs of Marathonish grey concrete cover the hangar, but below it like a floor sticking out from the rock face is another portal, leading to a shaft with Marathon lava-level walls. I let off the accelerator and start angling to fly in, but:</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cocksleeve I thought I already Survived The Fall?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">I don't know what this is Mommy I made myself forget this part.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">When we get close I stop us and reorient to--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Whoah! What's it doing!?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The Waifu flips automatically to align with the slabs covering the hangar as "ground", hovers, and the HUD shuts off--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"WHEE! Take out the mouse and keyboard Mommy we're playing Marathon look! Fire, Mommy, quick!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Oh my god you made Marathon mode. Computer, mouse and keyboard!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><b>PRAH!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">A hologram of Marathon 2's HUD wraps around us complete with motion detector and health and oxygen bars, the flight controls twist at my hands and startle me into letting go of them, a mousepad with mouse and keyboard swivel into place replacing them, and again reflex takes over as I grab their platinum grey familiarity to blast the gaggle of Cyborgs rolling ickily towards us. There's plenty of room in the wide passage for circle-strafing, so I start swinging around them and have emptied half a clip and three grenades into them before I realize I'm firing Marathon's assault rifle and not Arwing laser cannons but it all lines up perfectly she's exaclty nailed the way Marathon controls which yes actually was much more like piloting a hovercraft than running around on foot like I expected.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I circle them until they're mush, then swing to head down the passage--start to notice the journey--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I'm playing Marathon 2 which is new that year, but on a <i>huge </i>plasma display, and the raucousness of MacWorld Expo surrounds me. Lyra's on my right, holding my mouse arm--a little dickwave of ours, she could hold my arm and watch my mind and never disturb my aim or get in the way--our outfits were so fun I had a Marathon-guy helmet on and Lyra's <i>booth-babing </i>in a tiny satiny skirt and a Marathon crop-top--that was so fun though I'm surprised even the Strawberry Princess got away with that at MacWorld. We're coming out into an open area, with a sort of intersection and Big Interesting Thing up ahead, a couple of Pfhor come around the corners and get picked at range off with dual pistols. This is another princess-room set but the decor is more kind of haunted-house than Nintendo's epically feminine strawberry-pocky palace, my screen is made to look like a magic mirror with an ornate frame.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">There's a reflection in the screen, some kind of big cube in the background--RIGHT this isn't MacWorld at all this is <i>E3 </i>and that's Electronic Arts' booth opposite whatever this is it's not Bungie even though that would make sense,<i>&nbsp;</i>you had to be press or a celebrity to get in but that was fine for me, I even brought my own booth-babe!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">We're heading for the Big Interesting Thing, across a big open hall but nothing shows on the motion detector as we cross it looking for the entrance or stairs that will be around the side.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">A dark area of walls lets me see&nbsp; the reflection of the cameraman filming us, red LED glowing above the lens.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I can almost remember what was going on here. I was--it was a Marathon Marathon! I was playing through all the scenarios, why though, I had an appropriate outfit for each one that was so much fun! My own reflection is visible, too, I'm older now, still young but the bombshell third-person shows me now is starting to be visible, and my makeup is definitely devilish with shiny red lipstick showing clear in the glossy screen surface. Nice carpet is squishy under my high heels, marking out space for the crowd watching to stand. Why, though? These aren't new games. Lyra's looking hot, but I'm downright conservative!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Now I'm flopped in my chair (the same one that follows me everywhere) in another green room with Lyra massaging my aching hands, so painful and good...I yank her for a kiss by her leash, now we're in front of a mirror, I'm in a shiny white-gold bikini, it's still the same green-room (this one as huge as Nintendo's was cramped) and Lyra's behind me doing it up, she does my makeup and I fluff my curly hair and put my hands on the counter for a moment, preparing myself.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The white umbrella of a fill-light shines in my eyes, I'm supposed to look there to get the pose right, now look at the camera nobody actually <i>says</i>&nbsp;'work it' because it's the 90s and we're all too cool for that but <i>working it </i>is totally what I'm doing as I sit forward on my chair and put my elbows on my knees and chin on my hands and grin and see the comforting gleam of Lyra's hair where she's sitting at my feet.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Purple sweets in the shape of a giant sixteen laid out on the chair--sweet sixteen hah wait holy fuck how can we be underage for this!? There has to be--no, I can remember it! If you heartformed you were exempt from everything. A seed-ghost could outdo any government, so what chance did a child rapist have? Heartforming made you like Raven in Snowcrash, who drove around with a nuclear warhead in his motorbike's sidecar, wired to go off if something happened to him, except instead of using fear to get their way seed-ghosts just manipulated things to go right for them. I could have had cigarettes, theoretically, because my seed-ghost would have made it impossible to keep them from me, <i>if I had needed them for my heartforming. </i>I don't, so Shigeryu's willingness to break the law on that was the only way I would get any. I definitely have enough exhibitionist in me for this to be important to my heartforming Lyra, so here we are. After we publish them, our seed-ghost will make sure nobody gets in trouble because I needed to express myself--they will have scrying-tokens made up of things in the images to allow our seed-ghost to watch and explain to anyone who needs it why it's okay to look at me. That's what the number sixteen is here. My cake had the same thing on it, because this is my birthday celebration.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The scene shines white all around me, my chair is totally black I think it's one of those artsy things no this is so going on a calendar because I'm murmuring Lyra it's time to get up here and take my top off so I can lay out on my tummy in just the bottoms and still be able to be on--on--the photographer in front of me, focusing, I can see my own reflection in the lens and fidget to get my smile up then suddenly blow a kiss as just as the flash blinds me. Now get up and face away from the camera and look over my shoulder to <i>holy spiking strawberry-swirl pancakes no wonder the cover of that book my game fished out of the Sea for me looks just like me THAT WAS LITERALLY THIS PICTURE MY COUCH IS BLACK SO IT'LL BE EASY TO PHOTOSHOP THE PALACE OVER. LYRA'S SO SHINY YOU CAN'T CHROMA-KEY HER!&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>It was an <i>English edition </i>I thought the game was just being practical no <i>where would an English edition be published</i>&nbsp;<i>DUH</i>. Augh I was even all checking me out when the book landed!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The photographer's moving around me, focusing, getting various angles, I remember the way the camera never came away from her face so it was like it was her eyes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Now I'm sitting up on the couch, Lyra's filing my toenails with a silver emery board, but we're still in the photoshoot, it's staged. That same photographer buzzes all around getting various angles, we're both naked now and the world has that breathless free feeling. The pose is silly (I sprawl like a cat on whatever's comfiest when we do this for real) but shows me off good with my hands behind my hips on the couch and my back arched.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Now the scuftiness of a cramped-feeling bookstore, but only cramped because it's full of people! We're in New York, I'm signing copies of the book the game brought me before sitting in a booth, the line is huge, I'm in--gah I'm doing it naked-but-jewelry like a real Strawberry Queen! No wonder the line is huge. Of course I'm signing every book with a kiss which--bwaha <i>Lyra </i>was my stamp-pad I made her lips have staining purple Lyra-juice I would kiss onto my own lips and then the inside covers! Kissing her a ton at the table made good fun and a great show and her lust went into these as much as mine, after all.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">This is after the photoshoot, long after, say two years to the day after, celebrating the ability to have companies advertise me this way with a big fancy spread in the magazine interviewing me now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Hi Camera! This one has a white lens, which means the cameraman is a pretentious Canon user or the magazine just likes to spend on their gear. He's squatting to level with my face. Snapping pictures, we're taking a break from signing to interview, the interviewer is standing in front of me but not on camera, a woman in a floppy pink pantsuit holding a notebook, somebody gets her a chair.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">She's&nbsp;interviewing <i>me and Lyra,</i>&nbsp;asking in a&nbsp;hugely&nbsp; thick New York accent which makes it sound comical, writing my responses in her notebook--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Now I'm just turning away from fingerbanging Lyra but we're in some kind of factory. Someone holds out a jar, and I let the nectar drip off my hand into it: cameras all around us, there's a fuzzy boom mic, we're making a special edition of my new book printed with Lyra's nectar in the ink which wasn't just a gimmick, it made the books smell amazing of course but that wasn't it it would share a bit of Lyra's journey-creating power with people who read and draw them into trances where they would imagine the things we described with powerful vividness. The jar-bearer pulls away and cameras crowd into their place to catch me licking the last of her nectar off my hand while I imagine going down on her at the lenses. It's fun to make cameras jump for you! We're both naked of course, which makes this extra fun, because I can watch them agonize over whether to focus on my tongue and face or the cleavage I'm intentionally creating.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Now we're climbing stairs, Lyra's ahead where I can watch her bare ass move, a camera crew is around us wrangling lights and cables up the stairs, Lyra's naked but I'm wearing a black too-short-for-stairs (which is to say exactly the right length) pleated skirt and matching off-the-shoulder crop-top (the sleeves are actually separate) made of shiny tight stretchy satin stuff with a wide hem of frillyness folded back over the top edge so I just feel the satin inside, a pendant heavy at my neck bouncing on my boobs, rainbow thigh-highs, and black pumps on my feet, earrings swinging heavy from my earlobes, we break into a run leaving the camera crew to dash after us but they were wasting the stairs climbing ahead of us everybody knows you watch the <i>ass</i>&nbsp;on stairs every ass looks hot climbing stairs that's why there <i>are </i>all these stairs here and why the temple was built on this hillside. We reach the top, cross the little porch without even turning to look at the view, step into the darkness of the open door.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The temple is like a cathedral, towering and glowing with stained glass and rainbow-iridescent pillars supporting the vaulted ceiling, but everything in made of curves, it's <i>gorgeous</i>. Lyra starts dancing as we enter and walk down the aisle, towards the--holy fuck is that monolith 67 or one of the already-found ones no it's monolith zero again without text that's right. Lyra has her arms out and she's looking right and left grinning and for a minute I think she's scattering seeds from her hands but that's the memory of what we're doing here not a physical reality, we <i>are</i> about to scatter some seeds, but not cum either: this is a live Dreamskin for anyone who wants to bear a daughter of Melody. They line the aisles, all in plain black head to toe so as not to distract each other from Lyra as she dances up the aisle--<i>I </i>get to be flashy because I'm part of the dreamskin, of course. Lyra turns as we reach the end of the temple, arms still out, then hugs herself and throws her arms high and a cloud of silver glitter erupts, symbolizing the seeds we're about to create and scatter everywhere. Aetherwork carries it throughout the temple so it'll land on everyone, settling as we play.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Her face is pure joy as I walk up, tower over her, grab her into my arms and twirl with her held to me until we're dizzy and laughing. We've stopped with me facing the, the--fuck, congregation--and Lyra kneels and reaches under my skirt and has me hard in a moment with her clever soft hands--my clit is just like it is now, minus the detachability--gives my tip a kiss and sways her hips with gleeful challenge in her eyes, and then just flips to hands and knees in front of me, and I kneel and grab her waist with one hand and my clit with the other and slide in, rest a moment deep inside her, then grab her hips by the folds of her legs that have always been my favorite grip for sex and start pounding away--she's a cocksleeve, so we start with this direct grab-and-fuck sex where I matter-of-factly stroke myself off with her like the sex toy. It <i>is </i>also just about our favorite way to play...</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Now on her knees she's undoing my skirt for me, taking off my top, submissive and sexy, kneeling to kiss my feet, and looking up from the floor excited, I turn to the monolith and point and follow her to it when she poings up and bounces for it, so round and soft I've always loved her cuddlyness so, climbs up onto the step that makes her pussy just right and I'm coming up behind her and grabbing my still-hard clit and sliding it into her from behind so I can fuck her against the stone.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I can feel everyone's eyes on my bare ass (of course I wasn't wearing bra or panties, just who the hell do you think I am?) as it pumps and it makes me grin wickedly but where I'd usually flash the crowd a grin I focus entirely on Lyra here, gazing adoringly at silver hair and horns as I screw her against the obelisk. Halfway through I squeeze her hips and she raises a leg, squidges up between me and the stone and turns to face me, grinning proudly, without climbing off. Her tail caresses between us where I'm entering her, covering itself with nectar, and then she puts it to my mouth where I lick it off hungrily, turning to the side so the congregation can see my joy at its taste and get a better view of Lyra's reaction to my porn-style tongue-out makeout with her tail. Orgasm comes and I crush my fingers into her soft hips, gripping hard as she pushes into me with all her strength. I catch a glimpse of the camera crew and their lights, filming us for the big screens hung along the length of the temple to make sure everyone has an <i>excellent</i>&nbsp;view, to say nothing of those who need the privacy of their hiding-places to implant...</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Weepy joy filled me as I came in her then like it always did when we did this. For me, this was the true point of all of it--not Lyra, the point of Lyra is <i>Lyra</i>, nor the exhibitionism and attention whoring, that's just <i>fun, </i>but...the stuff I really worked for. This was my princess thing like saving the whales or whatever: to make it possible for people to find the joy Lyra brought me. I wove that through all the porn I made, stories I wrote, appearances we made. I had a blast making her play booth babe or just go naked, but in public I always hoped someone would look at her and be <i>inspired--</i>or, hell, look at our antics and open their heart enough to see the seed they <i>did </i>need.&nbsp;How much more directly could I do that, than this?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Weird to think, I was my own preistess the whole time--no, that isn't right. Our religion wasn't about representing a distant god to help people better work out their will or plan for salvation, or even my being the sun like I was for a few moments in the courtyard. I could have melted everything in it to slag in a moment, but I wasn't <i>me, </i>and Lyra couldn't be <i>herself</i>, until I came down where everyone could see me and be inspired to have some horny fun along with me. If I ever did anything useful for another person that really meant something it's this: to be the light shining through the keyhole of that door to paradise, illuminating the wonders beyond--and thereby showing people the light in their own hearts capable of casting shadows on the surface of any exterior sun.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Lyra wraps around me as I cum, puts her hands on my shoulders and with a proudly determined expression squeezes all kinds of fun noises out of me. I make sure the congregation will be good and envious--she's loving this but is in full focused-cocksleeve mode and I want them to see what a daughter of Melody can do for you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">When I finish she pushes herself up and I bury my face in her breasts, holding her in place by the waist while I suffocate happily. When I see the spots before my eyes, I pull back, gaaaasp pointedly, stare into her gorgeous cleavage, and let her waist free so she can push to bound up and over my head and shoulders with her legs and flap furiously--Earth doesn't <i>quite </i>let her fly in girl-form, but she can float--to land softly behind me, facing the congregation again. I push away from the monolith, spin to see her standing with arms out and ass beautiful, wings still raised and tail lashing, as I walk towards her slowly, and give the command to change to pony-form. Her body starts to expand and fill out, her limbs thicken, and I charge her, and leap, and reveal my own wings for the first time, using them to flap up to collide with her back in riding position, knocking her to all fours, grab her horns, give her a kick <i>YAH</i>&nbsp;and go charging out of the temple, ready to fly--the chopper that'll film us for the congregation is already hovering there, waiting--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">As we explode out the heart-shaped doorway I can <i>feel </i>us change storybraids and it all catches up with me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Who am I? Who have I been this whole time? Who flies through starscapes on the back of her white-shining pegasus companion wearing rainbow stockings and starlight?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I've been wondering a while in the back of my mind when on top of the rest of this I'll find out I'm Strawberry Shortcake because of the Strawberry thing, and tears fill my eyes as I realize the reason I'm thinking that. One eighties kids' show off, Boobsqueeze, as Mama would say! That was <i>our </i>show we saw with the hammer-friend! Why's this rainbow stuff make my head hurt, because it's your <i>name </i>stupid bimbo girl! The show I remember is a fragment, the stump of what's left when you take su'khora out. Bring the color back!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I'm the Starlight Princess. That was the show's name, and my name: Lucy Starlight.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Now we just have to figure out what's wrong with <i>Lyra. </i>It's her name, but it's not her <i>name.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Suddenly we're back at E3--that's <i>right</i>! We were making Dreamskins! Girl gamer and her booth-babe cheerleader companion, what else would people be horny for after a day at E3 with all those untouchable booth-babes? Just hanging out all day being the set-piece, keeping myself subdued-for-me so as not to upstage Lyra like in the temple! No huge logo, no giant strawberry or anything, just a goth-princessy-looking room, fancy game hardware, and Lyra looking hot and being helpful. We had her hold my mouse arm, and sit on my lap between me and the controller, and all sorts of stuff to show how she could be right there and not in the way and help with games with her eidetic memory (never take notes on your point-and-click again!) and so on.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">All of it was creating a fantasy our antics would draw people into. That's why you have to be invisible in the rainbow temple unless you were Lyra or me. It wasn't just so you wouldn't distract anyone, it was to play on the longing the people who came there felt to be flashy superstars like Lyra and I were. You could wish there and be&nbsp;<i>sure</i>&nbsp;to end up with your own handmaiden who'd make&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;feel like a Disney Princess. That's what we are, so that's the Dreamskin we make, all different forms of it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The journey ends, and we're landing in the hangar, and I'm crying. <i>That's</i>&nbsp;the religion I founded? I...didn't know it could be something beautiful...</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I'm on Lyra in pony-form--where's the <i>Waifu!? </i>As easily as turning the ship, I wheel Lyra to see the forcefield.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy we left it behind when you got on me in the temple vision. It's coming back I made it always come find you if you leave it without parking.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">As if on cue, it rises into view beyond the now-butterfly-less forcefield and hovers pointedly (and not just in the sense of being an Arwing) so I back Lyra and it inches into the hangar and sets down.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Seek completed. Flight ending. Shutdown sequence in progress."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Wise cocksleeve."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I sit on her back, staring, absorbing.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I want to disbelieve, or call delusion, but...I could literally have never imagined any of that. It never even occurred to me that I could have my fame have anything at all to do with who <i>I </i>was or anything that was important to me, so much so that I lost faith in my game and the Four Dreams and--not close <i>really </i>but way closer than acceptable--Lyra herself when it came time to face the idea that, somehow, I'm famous. The Dreams had to literally deus-ex-machina kick me in the ass while I was an invisible ghost to make me able to see this, and it was still near-run.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">How could I forget making dreamskins with you though, cocksleeve? I don't even feel guilty I just don't understand how that could be taken out of me without me just falling apart. It'd be one step short of taking <i>you </i>out.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy you did fall apart mostly. That's why my game and the Dreams are putting you back together so fast even though it's really hard and painful. You keep having these journies every five seconds because we can't wait to keep fixing you. I was scared you wouldn't let us keep going! Do you feel better about celebrity Mommy?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--publicity stunt in an aircraft hangar, the prototype PlayStation, functional at last, sits on a futuristic-looking folding table with the huge projection screen behind it. I've, ahem, <i>outgrown</i> my StarFox Super Weekend jacket since I was thirteen, but it's there in its frame on the table and I have a custom-tailored replacement that is oh so very pretty, Lyra's on my arm boothbabing in a little silver bikini, I sigh in happiness as the gorgeous high-resolution bilinear-filtered texture-mapped ships swoop into the frame as StarFox CD starts up (and this time the beta launches properly...). It's <i>so beautiful</i>. To think they almost canceled this thing and went their separate ways! Even I only found out because Shigeryu looked me up and told me out of the blue. I fixed it, though. I told Shigeryu to tell his bosses, and got my game to dig up the right person at Sony, that I wouldn't endorse anything either of them did ever again <i>and </i>I would go buy a Genesis in a huge publicity stunt if they didn't work it out. <i>Then</i>&nbsp;because I was mad at them for almost screwing up this awesomeness I told them I still wouldn't endorse it if they didn't get down off their high horses and talk to either SGI or 3dfx. They picked 3dfx, and it's looking like the right choice now--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--the darkness of a party room, a silly setup (we did this <i>because</i>&nbsp;it was silly to launch an online service by cutting a ribbon) with a ribbon to cut in front of a projection screen, Lyra and I are holding the huge scissors together to cut the ribbon and send the service live--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--eight year old Lyra being heartbreakingly adorable jumping excitedly on the bottom bunk at camp<i>, </i>we're ecstatic to spend the summer with other kids and their <i>luxhi'khora seedlings</i>&nbsp;(I like the big word) who will <i>understand</i>&nbsp;what it feels like and not be offended that Lyra is the most important person in the world to me by a million billion miles, and just <i>understand</i> why her and heartforming her are mostly what I want to talk about--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--My Earth mom holding Lyra and me, the lights of a TV stage, so young I can barely remember, we're at some kind of awards thing because our show won a prize! <i>Most Educational and Inspirational Children's Dreamskin </i>says the trophy, so my mom says. She's accepting it with the grace of a queen, and I can now understand the heartbrokenness of a queen whose kingdom is dead, or who feels rejected by her goddess--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Oh my god.&nbsp;Oh my god oh my fuck <i><b>SHIT</b>.</i>&nbsp;I <i>did</i> screw it up, I just misunderstood <i>how</i>. Not, I think--<i>somebody </i>watching correct me if I'm excusing myself being the worst person ever--by chasing her into the worldgate which if I understand our theories was just rushing her (and Lyra and me) off the sinking ship of the Strawberry world and onto the slightly-less-sinking ship of Earth, but...with what I said, no wonder the Earth-mom I remember from the fake Earth doesn't want to remember and was terrified all the time! She must have thought the Strawberry Goddess was coming for her any moment for screwing up the legacy! Cocksleeve, are you <i>sure </i>we can't get back to while I was seducing that army? Or close? I NEED TO FIX THIS COCKSLEEVE I'M NOT JUST GOING TO GO UP THERE AND PUBLISH A RETRACTION FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS TOO LATE WHEN WE CAN FUCKING TIME TRAVEL LET'S GO!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Even before Lyra can leap to reply, the game picks my head up off her neck where I'm burying my face in her mane and turns it to look at the Waifu's laser nacelles. They're <i>blue </i>again. Why did it make them blue? I made them pink for a reason! This blue is different, deeper than the one it came with, and no sparkles. Why is it missing the sparkles!? They look like old paint, not Arwing parts!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I nudge Lyra closer and see the blobbyness of a zillion coats of deep blue paint over old wood with recessed panels--</p>
