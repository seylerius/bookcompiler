    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">71 - Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd"></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I lean back, careful of Isht Visht's floppy rest in my cleavage, and stare at the ceiling, and her soothing hands start to work in front. I was surprised she didn't use magic at first, but Isht Visht didn't need to spend half an hour <i>undoing </i>my old make up by carefully groping my face to get me ready for her design. They wanted an excuse to touch me lots. The point of this was to be close to me. I was afraid of this because I thought it would be another try at giving a new shell to me, or replacing the parts inside of me that are ugly to them, but all they wanted was to have time to play with the person they just got <i>out </i>of her shell not so long ago, and catch up on hugs while doing something fun.</p><p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Pussywet just another few rollers, and then we can do your skin-glitter. The fusing bell feels fun for Fairies, as I've heard it!"</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">&nbsp;Mama finishes with the rollers and pushes my head back down to look at the screen--it feels <i>so awesome</i>&nbsp;when she moves me around like that--where Twilight is looking sad because the adventure is over and she has to leave the friends she's made (except of course she gets assigned to live with them and report her 'findings on friendship' to Princess Celestia, which its obvious everyone knows is a transparent excuse to command her to stay in Ponyville and spend time with her new friends, except they all love that). It's obviously setting up the format of the show as an adventure with Twilight explaining what it teaches about friendship at the end, but it's cute and reminds me of the game commanding the four of us to become a family which is was we all desperately wanted but need the game's being in control of it to dive this fast into it without freaking out. Much.</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The game turns my mind back to far back the tower of life experience we've climbed since the nursery aboard Isht Visht to where Lyra was telling us the game's plans for me as messages from our seed-ghost because I didn't know what was actully happening yet.</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">There was something--the game would stop me every so often and make me write about my experiences and share the writing with people outside our household. There was something else, too, about missions, and the game making me follow everything step-by-step so I would--oh my fuck. There are <i>weekly episodes </i>and I'll write a letter to 'Celestia' after each one and the game told it all sideways and just slightly off like the early monoliths so I'd start getting used to the idea without panicking.</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I wonder what terrifying wonderful message the monoliths have for Isht Visht's prophecy club they need to be warmed up to over thousands of years? I'd been thinking we were pranking them for taking everything too seriously, but now...that's mean. I think our family likes jokes, but not mean ones. Hmmm--wait:</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Who's 'Celestia', game?</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: I'll get the answer through being little for Mama and giving her the home life she's wanted for a very long time. There won't be a way to miss or avoid this, so I can relax and just be pretty and fun.</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The episode ends on Pinkie Pie chattering excitedly about her new friends.</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I just can't seem to get myself off that porch though--I'm back in the house, we went inside, it was 70s dark wood and plaid, Colleen made me feel safe like Mama does, she could take care of me, I was a picky kid and would scream like I'd lost Lyra if my Earth mom gave me to anyone but Colleen but I <i>liked </i>Colleen and looked forward to spending time with her...she made me feel <i>good</i>. Can I have been into her like I am Mama? She wasn't my mother though! Game heart brain cocksleeve why am I here what is this about!?</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy listen. Aren't you hurt that Colleen abandoned you? Yes it doesn't make sense rationally Mommy but what five year old has that much reason? How could you know she had to stay back in Maine because she lived there? To a five year old who just wants thier Mommy that doesn't matter!</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">You're right because I'm in the car leaving Maine too but--are you saying I think Mama's going to do that to me too? I KNOW SHE WON'T <i>NOW</i> BUT--I mean it just takes time to build trust and we haven't even had half a day, even the Dreams and your game and you yourself altogether can't--</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Bristling poised I see you need me I'm ready to do <b>anything</b>.</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The Dreams show me a golden glass cutter cutting a biggish hole in glass and then knocking out the glass in the middle to make an opening and I can't help thinking they're cutting open a display case somehow.</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: it's all they've <i>been</i> doing since Rada opened the airlock to find me and Lyra standing there making out and dripping wet. Everything we've done according to guidance from the prophecy has been part of it and the rest of our time together yet we haven't been able to see far ahead because we can't steer by anything but wishing to be our family.</p><p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"The dreams just showed me a tool that looks like a musical note making circle in a glass box like the one from Snow White the dwarves made when they thought she was dead. I say that means we need more ponies, because that song is waking you up every time you sing it with us, Pussytaste!"</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Mama starts the next episode--</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Rada wait just hang on a second! Mommy listen to me try to remember what did I say in your bed in your Earth house when I came to come get you? The very first thing I said before you kissed me or anything. Can you remember, Mommy? Think hard I saw you misheard me but you remember it right I could see you you just weren't ready for me to call you that so your brain didn't take it like the smell of your strawberry sugar cum."</p><p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Sis what are you saying? I thought the crown freaked you out like Lucy. Are you saying you knew already?"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"No sis I'm saying I know what that vision means and my Mommy needs to hear what I said to her when I first saw her at the start of our trip to get home here. She needs to hear it herself don't give anymore hints please."</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The Dreams show me a tornado when I try to reach for the memory. <i>Huh</i>? Auntie Em? Picking up my house whooshing it off to Oz?</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><span>Reaching for the memory again takes me back to Colleen's brother's house instead it was </span><i>nice</i><span>&nbsp;there Colleen was taking care of me and I felt free of of of </span><i>something </i><span>what cares does a five year old even </span><i>have</i><span>&nbsp;and why does trying to remember the moment I met Lyra in Stamford take me here?</span></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">She said a lot of things I missed them no she repeated herself because I was sleeping she would know which one was the first I was awake for --utie this is like the monoliths I heard something like what she was saying but it wasn't the exact words <i>come on, wake up, cutie </i>what words sound like that that she would say to me would she call me <i>cutie </i>she would say would say would say <i>COME ON, WAKE UP, USE ME--</i>no, that isn't right RGH!</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Come on, take me, beautiful.</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--still doesn't feel right cocksleeve I'm trying but I can't remember I don't--</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The Dreams show me a beautiful makeup case with pink satin quilted sides and a white leather edge and gold hardware, perfect for a Strawberry Princess it's beautiful I want it but WHY IS THAT HERE DREAMS I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS!</p><p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"That's a beautiful makeup display case! I think we all see the same visions, yeah? Boobsqueeze I have one like that in my cargo hold! As soon as we finish here I'm getting it for you. It's just what a Strawberry Princess needs to keep all her makeup! Klapta, get off now, it's time to do her artwork and glitter! Boobsqueeze I have a design that goes on your shoulder and arm but you'd have to let go for me to paint it. If you have to stay holding Lyra, that's okay, but I think you would like this one!"</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">There's an answer that fits the syllables and sounds like cutie, but--I twist my grip on Lyra tighter--</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The Dreams again, tight-coiled copper wire--that's the antenna to the AM radio I built from a kit when I was a kid. I spent hours listening, fascinated with how it could draw enough power from the air to be audible, it was nothing but a resonator and the sound was crunchy-mushy and tiny like the voice of my videogame eravahk so the words would sometimes...sound like other words...yes Dreams I figured that part out already--they're responding--</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Lyra, standing beside me, seen in a massive old mirror with the silver flaking off, in her demon-form so vivid and clear it's like seeing her as Freddie in the doorway but the room we're in is bluish and massive and the mirror silvery-ornate instead of golden and hanging in the living room in Stamford like the big antique mirror my parents have it's weird though I'm clearly standing right beside Lyra but I can't see myself maybe I was just too busy ogling Lyra she was in full silver-demon mode and as beautiful as always WHAT THE FUCK SELF THAT'S THE DREAMS NOT A MEMORY I like what they showed yes it was beautiful but--</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Now they show me Lyra, on her knees to be fucked, I must be behind her, a leather leash is taut pulling at her neck and her expression is silly with her tongue out because she's just been knocked to the bed hot good idea--I'm watching the scenery roll by again as we leave Maine--</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">OH moving house. Holy fuck Dreams what are you doing are you changing our past again? Why now what the hell is happening!?</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Twilight Sparkle and Spike in the chariot on the way to Ponyville the first time. Being sent from Canterlot to live in the small town, but I'm already <i>from </i>an obscure farming town and Mama's whole project is making me feel like the Princess I technically am by blood, except.</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Except the Dreams are making perfect sense and this is as clear as their answer to what had become of Christianity. It's just that where that made terrifying hilarious sense, this is so many kinds of impossible I feel dizzy just trying to WHY AM I BACK IN COLLEEN'S BROTHER'S HOUSE NOW.</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Some kind of pink crystal what does that mean I don't know anything about rocks cocksleeve?</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy that looks like either salt from the Himalayas or maybe rose quartz the both mean healing though, salt purifies things like how cleaning them physically sucks toxins into the salt and out of what you're cleaning and actually Amethyst looks more like that Amethyst helps you take care of people.</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">So it's like Freddie again, but we haven't <i>done </i>anything, have we? Are they just doing it for us and if so what are they even doing!? I thought--you saw! Cocksleeve I know what you called me but it can't be! Did history change again!?</p><p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Cocksleeves get ready, we're doing something very extreme now."</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Lyra stands, lifting all of us, and my heart leaps at the idea of riding her even through the panic.</p><p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Hang on tight everybody!"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"HERE WE GO <b>PRAH</b>!"</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">She seems if to flap or leap and everything changes and we're in some kind of whirlwind and then--what the fuck is this where are we WHY IS IT MAKING ME CRY!?</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">It's dark, and firelight flickers on the canopy of the huge bed I saw in the background of the vision with the mirror. We're all still squeezed together on Lyra's back--</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Come on, wake up, Lucy!"</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I was RIGHT what the FUCK except it's coming from the <i>bed</i>, not Lyra I'm riding. Cocksleeve did you fork without--no of course not. What in the FUCK what is this cocksleeve you said I can't possibly have any past lives, especially not ones with you in them!?</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">It's not past life Mommy you remembered that's why you're so scared now this is you and me leaving Earth see there I am kneeling over you!</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">There she is on the bed, I'd know that ass anywhere, and the bikini she had, but--this REALLY isn't Stamford!</p><p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd"><i>Boobsqueeze here we are, do you recognize it?</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">When I look down, Isht Visht has cloaked us entirely.</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Mama what's happening!? We left from Earth in 1995 not the Strawberry Empire however long ago that would even have to be! My name is Lucy because my game named me after that story, not because I'm THAT Princess Lucy</i><i>! Is this some kind of history changing again YES I THINK I MIGHT RECOGNIZE IT BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!</i></p><p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd"><i>I think you'd better tell them what's happening here, Isht Visht.</i></p><p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr"><i>Okay you guys this is going to be EXCELLENT but you need to help us. Did anything happen you couldn't explain? Like with the key to the jail cell being right there at the end of Bill and Ted? Do you see what I'm getting at?</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>YES BUT I'M FROM STAMFORD ON EARTH NOT LITERALLY THE STRAWBERRY EMPIRE EVEN IF I DO WANT TO BE A PRETTY PRINCESS! No, there was something, the forcefield, but that explains perfectly why this is impossible! She's going to pull me I guess out of bed and there's two things wrong firstly I'm already a girl here apparently so I'm not going to go for the blowjob we used to consecrate the sword I used to protect us unless you're telling me there's such a thing as a feudal empire that doesn't burn a kid at the stake for witchcraft if they switch gender because of their demon lover AND also keep their dick OOOH <b>FUCK</b> I KNOW WHAT I RUINED FOR MY MOM--</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Shit we don't have time Isht Visht make a Federation shield generator fast and--cocksleeve what even was that you said it was a 'circle' so I thought you meant I was doing dreamwork to create a shield spell using Federation tech as some kind of metaphor but it wasn't was it it was Isht Visht but somehow we need to make your past self believe it was me right cocksleeve you were convinced I cast it and we would have freaked all out if it was somebody else, I couldn't have taken that then. THIS IS WHY THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE, THOUGH I got out of bed and we were standing by my dresser and I remember looking at this toy Enterprise-D I had and thinking 'dude seriously red alert' and I like heard the siren in my head and the shield went up and Lyra said I must have subconsciously cast from my wish to raise the sheilds because seriously. Maybe it doesn't matter because that's not why the shields went up, but I really don't think there's Star Trek toys in the Strawberry Empire!</i></p><p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr"><i>That's simple, I'll make a shield generator and you make out with me while I put the shields up! You have a kiss waiting anyway! Next thing what else are we Excellent Adventuring here?</i></p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><i>Mommy there's Cleavage. You had no intentions you just drew it with energy but the intention is needed to make things! Make yourself Cleavage Mommy!</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>I did have intentions--bwaha I guided myself! Using that dreamtalk thing you showed me cocksleeve, how do I send that? I need to tell myself how to make the sword I used to stab Earth. AND THEN I WANT SOME FUCKING EXPLANATIONS!</i></p><p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd"><i>You got it, Pussywillow, just make sure you get here to hear them! What else happened, did anything else seem like it needed setup?</i></p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><i>It's just like you made wind at the table, Mommy--</i></p><p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr"><i>Bwqahahaha!</i></p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><i>--sis you know what I mean!--just put the idea in dreamtalk and send when you remember feeling that guidance.</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>You saw me, right? Help me know exactly when what. I think that's it but we need that shield fast here we come I think!</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">On the bed, Lyra (Melody???) is finishing our "first" kiss--Isht Visht's hand on my chin pulls my face down to meet her and her tongue's in my mouth invisible but sure not insubstantial. She kisses me hard, I try to respond to her despite rising panic and her tongue flicks around mine, slippery and quick and arousing.</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">My voice sounds from near us, and I almost break the kiss <i>and </i>fall of Lyra yes to hear her voice come from her other self but mostly because:</p><p data-voice-id="wLf8QRk58">&nbsp;“What the hell? What...”</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I licked the ashes out of your eyes. Can you see?"</p><p data-voice-id="wLf8QRk58">"What's that&nbsp;<i>smell</i>?"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Miasma. If you cast a circle you can get rid of it. Want me to show you how?"<br></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">She sounds and looks just like "my" Lyra, and--w<span>ait, why can't I smell it? It was horrible! "My" Lyra answers instantly:</span></p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy the Four Dreams are protecting us this is a journey we're actually still home in our living room.</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Here they come off the bed, Lyra and in tow her--<i>Prince!? </i>Okay I understand this <i>now </i>her <i>Princess</i>&nbsp;but shouldn't my body have changed already? Especially if the palace decorator knows I'm a girl? And I'm in touch with my sexuality enough to sleep naked?</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">This room is blue though Mommy, look by the fireplace where it's bright, see?</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Okay I SO don't understand what's happening here.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><i>Sis wait until the door--AAH sis wait until I make the door slam that won't make us uncloak will it?</i></p><p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr"><i>You saw my face-print in Lucy's tits before, right? No wait you were busy yeah it's cool I can stay cloaked underwater you kicking a door shut won't decohere it!</i></p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Back to the door make sure I can reach it to kick it.</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Lyra backs and sweeps us to be ready while their dreamtalk rushes at a million words per second, which is good because--</p><p data-voice-id="wLf8QRk58">“What?”<br></p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">YAH!</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Lyra bucks which is weirdly sexy with how she moves and the door slams and Isht Visht does something and shields surround the room and then instead of quitting making out she <i>focuses </i>and seems to climb up me and push her face into me, then finishes and sits back where she was, radiating invisible satisfaction.</p><p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr"><i>Haaaah.</i></p><p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd"><i>You can kiss Isht Visht anytime till we get back to make yourself feel better, Sweetcakes.</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Mama thank you! She's FUN.</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">A little part of me wants to ask if that last part was strictly necessary, but I want to keep thinking it was strictly <i>UN-necessary.&nbsp;</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cocksleeve you have kissing to do too when we get back and I have the slightest clue what's happening.</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Fuck! Cocksleeve how did we turn the sheild off again!?</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I dreamtalk this to everyone for Isht Visht's benefit.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><i>Mommy it was your spell and you had the control button that's what we thought was happening remember? Sis can you make that? It just needs a psychic--</i></p><p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr"><i>You guys relax I made it seem like Lucy's obviously I put the control interface there too!</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Alright well now I remember we talk and stuff and then do the sword thing, SO THAT MEANS I HAVE TIME FOR EXPLANATIONS THIS IS AN OFFICIAL SPOILED PRINCESS DEMAND WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON!?</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>I mean I get that we're Bill and Tedding all the unexplained stuff that saved Lyra and me BUT WHY ARE WE DOING IT FROM THE STRAWBERRY EMPIRE ASSUMING THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE!?</i></p><p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr"><i>Lucy remember how when I was making that Galaxy-class hull I filled in with fanfic where canon had no designs? This is like that, we're filling in backstory where time has a hole. You and Lyra exploded the universe by opening a door into Limbo, that you created by stabbing it inside that egg thing. You made the backstory for the space portal you guys used to get out of Earth. This is the space you made by destroying the universe, and we're filling backstory in to give you and Lyra the best time in Limbo and after. You want to be the Strawberry Princess, and there's a space in your past where the stories we have in that book the game gave you can fit like a Lego. Yes you can replace it. What it means is you guys actually are Lucy and Melody. You already were as soon as I saw Lyra's flare from the raft you guys washed up on. I know that's confusing, hear me out here. Lucy is already a kid from Connecticut and you're already her kid-friend from however young she was when you implanted, sis, and yet you called her Lucy, you remember that the whole way, right? They're both true. So what why bother, why haven't we landed in Stamford and stuffed ourselves in the closet if you had one, you're asking me that now I can taste you girl. Alright listen up this is the fun part: by making you the Strawberry Princess who escaped into Limbo we're tying Earth back in time allllll the way back to the Strawberry Empire your family came from. Why do something that weird and impossible, you're asking? The Strawberry Empire died when a princess escaped with her seedling, just disappeared entirely. Sounds like what happened with you and Lyra! Tell me what killed it, civil war almost definitely, line of succession heir gone blah blah boring. You know what Captain and I found? Nothing. Zilch. Zip zero null it just disappeared one day. Sounds like something I saw happen when my aunt Lucy had some anger to work out in that weird recursive egg. I've been thinking that must have a reason for being inside itself like that. Earth and the Strawberry Empire, after we finish this, you'll find the Strawberry Empire as part of the mess you stabbed to get yourself out of Earth, and stab it just as mercilessly, which will create the obsession that makes Captain have Strawberry Empire porn to read as a just-ripe, and freak out when your crown floats up in a LaVerdier's bag. This whole thing's a time-loop and we're here hooking the ends up. That's how you're speaking English and still how your boy-form and Lyra still has that cute Starfleet bikini. That's from the Earth you stabbed and destroyed. We fit the palace over it because it lines up so perfectly somebody has to have planned this.</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>I'm not sure how I feel that that makes any sense to me--wait, I thought the Strawberry Empire died when my mom died? And why now, I was having flashbacks to the babysitter I think I had like a puppy love crush on when I was four, not this moment.</i></p><p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr"><i>We always assumed that because she was the last queen to reign and she came back on Earth as we found out going to meet her, but nobody asked how she got there! Lucy what was that saying, Vice is Nice but Incest is Best? That's practically a Strawberry famiy motto and reincarnation wipes the slate clean. I don't think she could remember it, or even have enough past left to reattach if she heard it just randomly. There's only one way she would get that, which brings us to why you having flashbacks to your babysitter who kept you while your mom had panic attacks because of the civil war she obviously went through has anything to do with you guys escaping to Limbo. Whatever is happening goes back way further than your Earth mom and us being here to save you and Lyra. You having flashbacks to that gave us access using Lyra's conflation-jump thing to here in this palace, at this moment, when you must be hiding while your Earth mom freaks out in her chambers. That means somebody planned this, so the chamber you have here would be right to conflate with your room in Earth in the 90s. This room was empty until we came here and to Stamford at the same time.</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>WHY THE FUCK WOULD SHE GO TO EARTH--Perfekti got her, didn't they. Oh my god perfekti got her and its my fault.</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>No, she has a family and everything! Like a whole history! She has to either not be who we think or have reincarnated after all.</i></p><p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr"><i>I don't know about that part but maybe things aren't like that. How can you know Earth wasn't her hideout in case the war got so bad she had to bail on her Empire, and her planet had enough dream to get one queen to Earth but not say do what you did to Earth without some serious hacking? The family she had there could be retainers for all we know. Or the rest of the family! Your family is weird, right? It's not like those manga where you isekai someplace without even a safehouse. If they could world-gate anything they would set up a system to take care of her if she had to get out of there. Maybe that system broke down, or she ran, I don't know, just what I've told you. I think Earth was her safehouse. Where would you go if you were a queen on the run? Earth's asshole, way out in the middle of nowhere, with no chance of being mistaken for nobility because you have sheep in your kitchen--no offense, just, not very queen-like.</i></p><p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr"><i>Hey you guys have sweet dynamics--I've barely seen you play with each other! I want a show when we get back!</i></p><p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr"><i>Anyway I keep half explaining this. We're here because Lyra's conflation-jump took us times you were hiding and feeling bad for your mom and wishing to save her and this place was one of them except only in Stamford so how the hell are we in the Strawberry Empire if this room was empty? Look by the fireplace, check out that secret passage! She must have run when you and Lyra appeared because we connected the universes, but your mom or her handmaiden must have had you in here to hide you. The only way we could get here is by you being in here as a baby or whatever the oldest before you remembered this would be. You aren't from Earth, girl, you might have grown up there, but this is your birth home. Welcome back.</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>OH MY GOD I JUST WANTED A MAKEOVER!</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Why am I Lucy--but--I was a girl! I--mean--okay how the fuck does Earth have the same name Lucy's a version of Lucia which is greek it means Light-filled if--wait not even that makes sense! Why did you call me Lucy, cocksleeve? Did my game say what it would call me?</i></p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><i>I said Lucy to say I remember this place Mommy. You hid with your handmaiden Colleen in the door until we came and she ran away to save you because she thought we were assassins or something. That's why you like her she raised you from birth even more than your mom did until she took us to Earth through the star-circle where Colleen is taking you right this moment!</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I can't breathe.</p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>WHY!? Why go to EARTH!? That's like having warp drive and heading straight for Cardassia! Was there some kind of reason they couldn't get to the Four Dreams?</i></p><p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">&nbsp;<i>You have to get far enough past feudalism, or get there before you invent it, to find them, girl. The idea that there can be a reality where authority-based government isn't only not how you keep the world functioning but not actually possible except as a playtime thing is so incomprehensible to the feudalist mindset they can't even imagine enough to dreamtalk with people there. It's a huge deal that we found a way in here period, to say nothing of how this room is prepared for us. There must be something big happening to make this set up like this.</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Isht Visht, how much radiation can your cloak hide?</i></p><p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr"><i>Why--spikes and Dawn in a jellyfish crumpet Lucy not now please!</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>She's about to suck me off and I'll make the sword. We're done here after that. When she and I leave, this world burns. You guys can stay--</i></p><p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd"><i>Pussywillow you already destroyed it. What else can you do from the inside?</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Create a legacy. All my life on Earth I've dealt with people making the world a hole because they can't imagine the simplest things, having technology that could remake the world if only they could see past their own stupid noses. I thought that was one of Earth's biggest problems. Now I see how bad it can be. This world has the literal door to paradise, and the only place they can figure out how to open it on is EARTH. It took the three of you and a prophecy and so much else to get me to see the good in Earth, and I do now, but that doesn't mean having the ability to choose between Earth and the Four Dreams and choosing Earth doesn't make you literally too stupid to live--because you'll probably walk off a cliff next chance you get!</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>A worldgate is a technology that comes with responsibilities, like any new tech. If you make fission reactors, you have to deal with the waste. If you make a worldgate, you DO NOT STOP IMAGINING THE PLACES IT MIGHT TAKE YOU UNTIL YOU IMAGINE <b>AT LEAST</b>&nbsp;THE FOUR DREAMS! NO, COMING FROM A FEUDALIST WORLD IS NO EXCUSE! YOU IMAGINED THE WORLDGATE IN THE FIRST PLACE, YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT TO DO WITH IT!</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Mama, don't worry, I'm not erasing the Strawberry Dynasty you grew up with.</i></p><p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>I'm creating it.</i></p>
