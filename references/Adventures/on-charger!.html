<article class="chapter 95---on-charger!">
    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">95 - On Charger!</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>Santa Claus!?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She's spectacular in white fur-trimmed hat and obviously no beard but she is still jolly-fat the same way Boobsong is. I don't quite understand why I think it's her and not just someone in a Santa hat, but I can't shake my confidence that's who they're showing me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">In the video beside her head, a girl in a 50s-nurse kind of uniform is pushing a cart of baked goods, but she's in a storybook, because that's what we see next. It opens and pages turn, but the book seems to be something like a physics textbook, with equations everywhere. The author is arguing for something, I think, because of how the equations seem to build on each other, but I can't read the text to know what the variables mean and I don't recognize any mc<sup>2</sup>s or Rocket Equations or anything--oh, because that's not the point. This is Santa's story told in metaphor's like Cherry's time in the "Navy" or rescue "at sea".</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now we're watching a rainy bus stop on a dreary winter day in some grungy city, close up to one of the ads. The reflection shows that we're looking out of the eyes of a robot that's a camera on top of a pole. The wheels or legs are out of the view, but the top part is defintely Prototype and not Product.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This fades into someone sitting with a VR headset over their eyes and controller in their hands, smirking oddly wickedly for what just seems like a first person video test. They're in the workshop they obviously built the robot in, weirdly like a kitchen with white walls and a stainless steel workbench.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now they're standing at a podium, with big silver tanks in some kind of factory place on the screen behind them. Wisps of liquid nitrogren, a frozen head: cryonics. The speaker is talking passionately, hands on the podium,&nbsp;<i>exhorting&nbsp;</i>their audience.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now a white bow on a wreath, but this is a funeral, not Christmas--the wreath stands on an easel beside the coffin in a whitish chapel sort of room, generic and plain. A thirteen year old ish kid sits in one of the pews, by themself, looking angry, and overlaid on their face is one of those black-and-white spinner-in-a-bulb things that spins powered by the difference in heat between the light and dark sides of its fins when you shine heat on it. People in the room talk, the kid overhears them, the spinner starts to spin, the kid's face hardens. The grown-ups are all comforting themselves (though I have to agree, kid, some comfort this is!) by talking about the inevitability of death and how it gives life meaning, and the more they do the angrier the kid gets. We go back to the podium, and I can see the kid's anger still hard in the speaker's face, powering their passion. This is for whoever was in that coffin, and if they could&nbsp;<i>show somebody the light</i>&nbsp;like I have over thier lost loved one, they'd be doing that, not this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The speaker is overlaid by the end of&nbsp;<i>The Neverending Story</i>&nbsp;where the Nothing of people stopping dreaming has destroyed the world of fantasy and all that's left is asteroids, Atreyiu riding Falcor, and the Ivory Tower with the Childlike Empress somewhere, but slowly that view all fades to white and is replaced by small black text, equations that read:&nbsp;<i>Can't win, can't break even, can't get out of the game.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now robots again, but we're still watching the speaker talk, overlaid again. They're talking about the singularity, and I cry for them because I understand that even though those cold equations are all that's left of the Neverending Story's world for them now they're still fighting for it, and will never, ever stop, no matter what the math tells them is impossible. The hardness in their eyes is beautiful, but there's a reason we're doing this Christmas Carol thing because I'm watching them forge the chains that bind them with every step of what they do saying to themselves&nbsp;<i>this is the world that's possible,&nbsp;</i>trying to rebuild the world they knew once even in theory, just by arguing it's possible to get there up a ladder of self-improving AI--and that might be a good ritual for it, but they'll miss that insight if they keep publicly precommitting to the idea that existence is fundamentally logical like this!<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The last scene of the video is a comic of someone wishing at a wishing well for "True Love", having a pretty girl take their hand and lead them happily away from the wishing well...and then looking wistfully over their shoulder at the next wisher flying off in their brand new X-Wing. It doesn't superimpose Isht Visht facepalming, but it doesn't need to.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Most likely to become Famine in the twenty-first century is--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Suddenly the briefing screen glitches away and we're pulled into writing journey--<i>no. No no no don't send us here Dreams WHY.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="RwNrPfoj4">The road back from the bowling alley is so bumpy. I'm tired and I miss Mommy and I wish I could get Mousie out of my pocket but I won't be able to until we stop because there's like 8 of us in the back seat here.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">WHY. FUCK YOU&nbsp;<i>WHY&nbsp;</i>DREAMS. I break out of it and wake Boobsong and hug her with all my strength while I wait for their answer.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">PRINCESS I'M HERE WITH YOU YOUR COCKSLEEVE ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE NOT NOW AND NOT EVER RRRRRRAAAAAH!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They show me the blacked-out silhouette of a heart-shaped bottle--holy&nbsp;<i>shit&nbsp;</i>Acme Station is that true is there a crack we could get some of that heartstone from fixing Freddie into there you'd be able to possess it then like your body now right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Checking super carefully...very very sure of this...yes there is a crack but it's not a very big one. Maybe just a little bit, a tiny small amount of it, but Mousie me will make it shapeshift into girlfriend form!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Riding a missile down to Earth from orbit. Its nosecone has a long spike on the end, and at the needle-tip something gleams bright Boobsong-silver.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"<i>Nuclear launch detected&nbsp;</i>Dreams how do we make it happen?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="v5MELBxAO"><i>Top, Write letter to Santa Claus and send it, Get out to the field before midnight</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Sweet screaming gingersnap cupcakes!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Before I even know what I'm doing I've hammered&nbsp;<i>Dear Santa please bring me even just a little bit of this heartstone I made to every place I needed it like this one time I lost my Mousie and also the apocalypse. Signed, Princess Lucy Starlight&nbsp;</i>into the black mirror and am scrabbling for a send button--</p>
<p data-voice-id="v5MELBxAO"><i><strike>Top, Write letter to Santa Claus and send it, Get out to the field before midnight</strike></i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Instantly we're back in the memoir-journey in the back of the car but this time Boobsong's&nbsp;<i>habe quiddam&nbsp;</i>from frying timelines is echoing in my ears and I half-wish for a physical keyboard to pound as I "type" because&nbsp;<i><b>habe quiddam</b>, past!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="RwNrPfoj4">Something sparkly comes in front of me and gets big really fast and then I'm crying and hugging Freddie really tight because she just appeared out of nowhere on top of me when the car stopped because she was always real.</p>
<p data-voice-id="oPAznjZQ5">GASP You see me!? YOU SEE ME AND FEEL ME HI ITS ME FREDDIE YES AND MOUSIE TOO HUG YOU!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The journey ends there but that's the part that mattered--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams interrupt to show me Earth spinning. On it, made of sparkling firework-stars in blue and green respectively, rotating the opposite way as the planet to show they're not tied to the landmasses, a&nbsp;Christian cross that looks like it's a four-pointed sword with no handle and a stabbingly pointy buck's antlers with "gleaming" points cover the world...for a moment--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh! One last hurrah, and the dreams want me to sermonize one last time! I'm a huge loudmouth, as you've noticed. Feeling more weepy again, in the black mirror, I "write" out my response to the vision:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Silver-sparkly rainbow color bubbles up out of shining points all over the planet to cover it until it's as swirly-striped as Jupiter, drowning the antlers and cross until they're invisible.&nbsp;<i>Good</i>. Santa's been&nbsp;<i>busy.&nbsp;</i>Welcome to the rainbow-colored apocalypse, Earth! Religion will never be the same after this.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That's what we're looking at. You can say every heartforming relationship is a tiny religion of it's own, with its own rituals and sacred things and holy texts and sepcial days between heartformer and seedling. You get healing, redemption, eternal life, and a pathway to paradise, and Boobsong and me are an example of how fun a toy worship makes if you want to play with it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Those are all the things Christianity makes people hold that sword with no handle for. If there's a way you can get them from a lover's embrace instead, how much chance does it stand as a global phenomenon?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">And yes, what was orderly now seems like chaos, but that's because we're seeing this from orbit. Everyone one of those shining colorful specks is a <i>person, </i>and if we were seeing this at the scale that mattered, we'd see <i>people </i>being themselves instead of painted blue or green and told to stand in a certain spot, just to get a chance at the afterlife. Individuality is only a bad thing if you want pixels (or neurons) instead of people!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">But I'm doing this entirely off that Christian cross.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"What were the antlers, seer?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"The antlers have points just like you can't hold the cross without it harming you if you put that inside it'll harm you and the Dreams are just saying Jesus as Thor is still bad for you in the same way. They mean cuz the cross Jesus as Christianity tells him not the real one the one where father god sacrificed him to the devil (that's Eden), and the Thor thing has antlers because he's a carpenter in real life so they can't say hammer so they said horned king (that's a pagan thing)."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Ooooh because Christian holidays all come from pagan ones, but--I remember, yay! It's just like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Xerox PARC! Steve stole their TV before Bill could. The ideas of sexy fun in the springtime, a big summer party, a spooky day in the fall when the otherworld is near, and a big fun feast in the wintertime are just human nature responding to a world with seasons like Earth has. Those ideas can't belong to anyone, so we're stealing the same TV Eden did, and giving people a way to celebrate that doesn't take them back to one of Eden's big all-conquering emperor-god faces. Let's rock and roll, game!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Level start sound.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Good luck!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">More clairvoyant visions instead of a journey?<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Yosemite at night, the stars brilliant--oh, it's the desktop of a MacBook. The speaker is at home now, they open a document, put their hands on the keyboard to start typing a new speech, the view zooms towards us, and we're looking at--the blank document, cursor flashing, little thick "end of file" line at the top because nothing is typed yet, and then this is suddenly what's on <i>our </i>screen in front of us, and Boobsong blinks out of her trance.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">OH! Black mirror time, cocksleeve! Tell them hi!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">HI! This is real you're not just imagining it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We can see them using the interface of their MacBook, quickly opening the Apple menu and choosing shutdown. The document closes, there's a moment of shutdown-spinner and Yosemite, and then the refreshing emptiness of a nice <i>black </i>black mirror, probably much to to-be-Santa's confusion who obviously turned their computer off specifically to get the hacker offline. Bwaha see what I'm thinking, snuggly?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Thank you so much for turning off the computer part! It's much easier with just this black glass. If you still think we just stole your computer and gave you a fakely off one, go find a glass thing that's dark like this and we'll talk to you that way no matter what you chose even if you go out and buy a new one at a store we don't know about.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">If you think of typing in a chat while typing on your keyboard, it might help you to talk back to us but if you want to prove our stuff is magic and not just sexy hacking use your mind and think stuff at the screen here. Just imagine it appearing and it will be!</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Very nice FX job--wait. 9528014673 what the hell is happening. Frequency bobsled hacked enough. This isn't theoretically impossible, but it's sure not likely! I guess I must be dreaming, and I notice I'm confused now, because my subconsioucs isn't likey to imagine a world in which I call my own voice in a psionic magic chat app <i>Santa, </i>nor would I use red with green backlighting to represent myself. There must be a reason I'd imagine this scenario, and it's likely that it matters, or I would dream something less symbolic. Let's just play along and see how it progresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Hello sexy succubus, are you here to tempt me? What's your contract cost me?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">You actually aren't just dreaming but we can play that if you want to! Yes we're here to tempt you that's me and Princess--</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">It's even more unlikely that I would dream of a chat app showing character-by-character message progress that makes me think I see you typing when I spend very often half my day using apps that go per-message. It also seems strange that my own psychic interaction would be able to differentiate between my internal thought states and intention to create this text here. Ballsy of me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Very sorry. You were saying?&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes we're here to tempt you but there isn't any contract, just funtimes. Want to hear some good stuff? You'll very super like it!</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Absolutely no exchange here? That must mean either that you intend to entrap me in some way, or that I'm imagining you're from a post-scarcity society where fun is your main interest. The latter seems more likely, since I appear to have fallen asleep while writing the latest chapter of my highly fictionalized vision of such an environment. That explains the appearance of a demon! I'm dreaming of a possible expression of sexuality that might occur under proper morphological freedom. Perhaps even existential freedom. What's your substrate?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">No exchange at all just super very fun stuff. Princess' sexy fun toy is a spirit made of ontological life-force.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">What's <b>your</b> substrate? She bets you say the wrong one!</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">The <i>right</i> substrate being whatever the simulation currently hosting me is using which is probably what you said. Very well, I'll play along here. Are we a game for you to play with, or something like a simulation to reconstruct us from historical data enough to upload our minds to the real world? If the latter, what should I expect next? If the former, I don't want to know, even if you think you''re benevolent.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Imagine I sound like Morpheus instead of a cute slutty princess: What if I told you there <i>was </i>no real world--aw fizzfrozen cucumberdust cybergoth jolly ranchers, cocksleeve how did neither of us think to open with <i>wake up, Neo!?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">WHAT!? NOO we so should have! Okay well how about Existenz. Just tell me one thing, we're still in the game, right? Nope! All of this is real every bit of it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Earth isn't a game or simulation, just a universe with problems our world is fixing. Wanna help? I bet you have some <i>opinions.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">You mean the simulation argument is correct for infinitely recusred simulations. That's elegant. I have publicly documented opinions. That's why you've chosen me, you have similar values! I accept. Let's begin with physical laws regarding computation. Can you increase from your level in the simulation-stack--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I think you'd better explain it, Acme Station. Um, I have a lot of names for her, Santa.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">So Santa actually the simulation argument heirarchy thing isn't really right exactly because the only actually real thing is consciousness. Every other thought is just a thing consciouness experiences so even stuff like math is made up out of dreams that rules exist and you can't break them. Yes there is a real world, and yes you're actually there now, but mathy rules it runs on are--</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Frog physics. Holy catchphrase--even on high amounts of hallucinogen I don't think I could create the string of characters <i>fizzfrozen</i>, to say nothing of the entire saying--how'd you say it--that seems very strange too. There's the text right there, clear and highly stable. Fizzfrozen cucumberdust cybergoth jolly ranchers, end quote. I can barely remember it psychically typing it out again, let alone hold all our trialouge so stably. I might be delusional, but it's very unlikely schizophrenia has given me eidetic memory!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess whisper just to you now your Acme Station thinks they need some proof now. What if she makes appear on Santa's hard drive a letter from us that won't just be a vision to decide was just a dream that didn't happen?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Whispering back: Brilliant! Good Acme station! <i>Can </i>you? Wait, game, PAUSE.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: we're having a timelike black mirror conversation. Time is passing only when we're "typing", and only then to show we type each "letter". We can take our time here.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Your Acme Station feels them but doesn't see them. The hard drive in their computer is easy to find along its wires, but she can't get much beyond that. She thinks this computer is enchanted, maybe from the writing of that story Santa said they fell asleep at.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Wordseed. Black mirrors integrated into Apple stuff. I bet there's enough leftover or bleedthrough or <i>whatever </i>I bet that's affecting things enough in her timeline to let us in enough to give her a sweet Sugarfeast.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay cocksleeve do it with their computer, but try to make the crack as big as you can. The more drama the better, especially if it's stuff they wouldn't know how to do or <i>couldn't </i>do so they don't think they did it themselves somehow.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">EeeaaaAAA--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She surprises me by going hyperintelligent--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">OOOF there GOT YOU! Princess your Acme Station made a program to run on the usb controller in Santa's laptop keyboard and type out this whole conversation. When she turns it on and types out more than fifty letters all in one long streak then there will come our words! She can keep on adding more as long as we keep talking but there's only fifteen K so it can't just go forever.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Then she made the sound chip have our sexy voices just a tiny small bit but they'll play right after startup.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Then she made the charger blink our names in morse code PRINCESS STARLIGHT BOOBSONG.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Then she said keep going and made the wall wart buzz to say our names too. It won't be very sexy and it will be so annoying but they really can't ignore it!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Then she said what more ooh make the desktop background into us porn! She hoped you wouldn't mind that but really didn't think so! Instead of Yellowstone now it has you picking up your cocksleeve by her D-ring to very tightly grope her boobs. You're standing on the Waifu with only just your jacket and of course your cocksleeve is naked.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Then she said what next let's be inside their camera! Every time they take pics there'll we'll be just waving thirty-four pixels tall was all there's room for but they'll enjoy the number!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">It'll come back if they fix any one device until they take the ROM out AND remove the hard drive not just reinstall stuff and even if they do that they haven't found the picture and our letter in their inbox it'll put there when they turn it on next!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Bwhahaha Acme Station, I hereby grant you the title Royal Hax0r. Not just <i>hacker, hax0r. </i>Do you understand the difference?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Not just only hacking, super 1337 and scary! Raah! Thank you Princess your Royal Hax0r is very proud now!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Good! Hehe I can feel you wetter in my lap now, right through all my petticoats! Grind you on my leg some.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Haaah...Princess....</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Funtimes soon, little one. You'll be useful horny now I bet...here we go.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">At the black mirror again: How about some physical evidence? Turn your computer on and hang onto your ontology.</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">What the hell was that sound--and <i>that</i> sound....Princess Starlight and Boobsong?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">How do they stop the wall-wart one so they can think, Boobsong?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Just unplug the cable for five seconds. It'll stay until you turn it off and come back next time you turn it on again.</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">How did you two do this? Is there even enough memory inside there to store that? WHAT THE HELL IS ON MY DESKTOP!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Um, hi. That's me with the cool hair and fun makeup.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">And her cocksleeve hanging from her D-ring to get felt up!</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Standing on an Arwing!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh, yeah, that's my ship the <i>Waifu</i>. My other car's the Whaleship from Final Fantasy IV. Want one? Actually I think you have a much more on-brand ride coming when the time's right...</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Alright, you win! I could never possibly invent this! Let me take this to a colleague and make sure I'm not just hallucinating but I really don't think I am now!</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">They see everything I can. Hear everything I can. How'd you find the space to fit a sound file into the half a k of program space in a wall wart <i>without </i>making it useless as a charger?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Yeah, how did you? I'd say she seat-of-the pantsed this all but she's never worn any.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">It's actually not programmed, only just the buzz that makes the sound come. The Princess Starlight Boobsong is resonant frequencies from capacitor tuning making each new part out of the buzzing of the last one.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Whispering: GOOD. JOB.</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">How could you encode that much complexity--no, you said that. NP hard is nothing if any math is frog physics. What's the real world <i>like </i>then!? Are you two weird or is everyone just as--holy catchphrase, how many of these are there!? I've just decoded the charger blinking out&nbsp; your names!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Enough to make our point. The real world is...<i>dreamy. </i>Boobsong, did you give them a copy of the Five Pointed Star?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">WHAT!? Of course your Hax0r thought of that Princess it's right there on their desktop!</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Yes, I've found it, will you be here if I take a moment to read it?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">(Okay here goes. Dreams guide me--Green checkmark. OkaaaAAAaaay...)</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Actually this connection is a time machine, so take your time, but read this first. The singularity happened at the dawn of human consciousness, and that story tells you how, but you won't understand it from where you are now unless you take a leap with me. Ready for a <i>really</i> crazy story?</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">How can you possibly--no, forget I said that. Yes. Hit me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I've tried once before to telepathically send the story you're about to read there about thirty thousand years back from where you are to someone on Earth because knowing it gives you the address of heaven which is useful if you can open portals to other universes, which I can and would like to teach you to do. I couldn't get it in despite having a connection as clear as this one because the person I was talking to was from a world that hadn't developed far enough past feudalism to understand some stuff about authority and order in there, so I had to timeskip forward thirty thousand years to when there's enough individualism for someone to understand.</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">...and you suspect I have a similar limitation, and you're asking me to self-correct, and the story's a reference pattern once I realize it's possible for my lens to be distorted, which a committed feudalist can't. Wait, that's before the ice age! Was there actually an Atlantis?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm prety sure what's in the fossil record as an ice age was actually something else, but we'll get there. It sounds like you get it about the story, so read it, and take your time understanding. I had to kind of just sit with it after for a while. From our side it'll seem like you read it instantly.</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">This is actually the literal address of heaven. I thought you were being pretentious aid workers. The limitation in my view is the exclusive use of reason to apprehend things. Heaven isn't made of rules to keep things working, nor is it managed by any kind of singleton or distributed intelligence. There wasn't a way for Dreamer to describe the things they showed to Thinker directly, he had to show the stories. The basic facet of existence isn't any fundamental particle, it's some foundational unit of stories--but I'm going too far by saying <i>unit.</i>&nbsp;Experience is ontologically prior to all other phenomena, and the explanatory gap seems either meaningless or unclosable because holy catchphrase you can't decompose set theory into arithmetic, can you!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Nope! Want more wham lines?</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">The only thing that's ethical is the portal. How can I help you make one?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Later I'm going to tell you a <i>really </i>crazy story and we're going to laugh SO MUCH about what you just said, but you're right. I actually made the portals already, enough to give everyone on Earth their own personal door, but it's sort of a process getting them connected. This is going to seem like I'm changing the subject, but I'm not, just bear with me, okay?</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Yes ma'am.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Only call me Ma'am if you want to end up like Boobsong on your desktop there.</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Anyway the wham line. How would you like to gain the ability to multiply your consciousness enough to be in millions of places at once and <i>personally </i>reverse entropy by conjuring out of nothing complex material goods (including ones that can go on reversing entropy without you there) people need or want which you'll be able to instinctively know what to give them if they don't just tell you, and be able to do it over and over again without feeling anything about it but exhilarating happiness?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">(a lot of this is project how I feel conquering the world for heartforming--chocolate birthday cake, say the Dreams. Born for this. Okay)</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Thereby <i>literally and in the most direct way possible </i>becoming Santa Claus. You can't be serious.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">What colors are you wearing right now?</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Holy <i>catchphrase </i>green stockings and a red shirt. I'm some kind of sleeper, aren't I!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">(HAH! I meant in the black mirror, but that works, and give me an awesome idea:)</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There are four big system-level things wrong with Earth right now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Saint John was hearing <i>you guys?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">(and now when they doubt they'll know that out of all the possible ways to take that they went for being one of the Riders, just like someone born to be one would, I would know)</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Okay I have to spell this out here in front of all my colleagues. Are you saying, that each of the horsemen of the apocalypse is meant to <i>fix </i>the thing they represent, like I'll be fixing Famine, because I <i>am </i>that horseman, and each of us are sleepers embedded in this universe, and now we're activated, and Famine's also <i>Santa Claus.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Yudowsky wants to know if my having Famine means he's tasked with Death. Seriously.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's a long story but I already know who the Rider of Death is, so no for him, but yes to the rest of it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Revelation 6:1. Your "horse" is an Arwing, just like mine's a sleigh. Who are Death and War, then?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Whisper just to Princess if you tell them to read verse 19 of chapter 16 they'll have super funtimes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">(OOH! What's it say--later.)</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Actually Boobsong here turns into to a Friendship is Magic-style batpegasus pony, and that's my horse, but yes. She has some fun for you now, actually--tell them the verse, cocksleeve.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Revelation sixteen ninteen, and read it with our picture on your desktop in the background!</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">You're <i>joking</i>. If the name on your leg is <i>Rainbow--</i>bollocks. It makes as much sense as Santa Claus, doesn't it.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Does it help if I tell you I found out I'm also techincially the Easter Bunny about an hour ago? Important stuff though: I'm not Conquest, you aren't Famine, and Death and War aren't Death and War. We're the <i>Riders </i>of those things, and we're riding them right into brick walls so they smash into a million pieces. I'm turning imperialism into just a kink thing (Boobsong's my handmaiden, get it?), I'm pretty sure the Rider of War is going to do like at the end of Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey and use her music to bring people <i>together </i>instead of making them fight, you're just going to <i>give</i>&nbsp;people stuff, and Death...okay I've basically died and come back at this point so it's easy for me to say but she's <i>conquering </i>death, not making it <i>stop</i>. If you <i>really </i>need to get into that we can but it's kind of intense and kind of involved and you have to learn what kind of transhuman I am which gets a lot into my sex life.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">You'll be hearing from the Rider of Death soon, but you might want to keep an eye out for the Rider of War. She'll need your help, I think, or you'll need hers.</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Are you guys <i>deathists?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I didn't <i>want </i>to die! Actually one of the Rider of Death's things is helping people find their loved ones who've died. No, way not, it's just that death on Earth isn't information-theoretic death even without cryonics. We like immortality. My Mama <i>lived </i>those thirty thousand years instead of skipping them, and she looks about twenty-five, or hehe maybe sixteen when I--you get the idea.</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Then how is that death not stopping!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Because sometimes you need to make a change so big it's the same thing as dying and coming back again. Think of it this way: you can make Famine <i>stop </i>with tons of resources, but you <i>break it</i>&nbsp;by destroying thermodynamics. If you make it so nobody can be killed, you make death <i>stop</i>, but if you make it so they can have that ending happen,&nbsp;and get the new beginning that comes from it without breaking their continuity of consciousness, then you <i>break </i>it. That doesn't mean it won't be optional!</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">You practice recreational <i>dying</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We practice recreational <i>everything</i>. Struggling to survive only exists as a game here. Now come on, let's get that door open. Have you figured out why I'm so silly--fizzfrozen sugar-frosted gummi bears refrences!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Sorry, just realized I'd been like twenty minutes without a candy swear.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Bad angle anyway. Let's just try some wishing. Make one. Anything. Big or small. Tell me or not.</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Well that's obvious I wish that door was open!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Good one. <i>I </i>wish you could see how awesome Boobsong is in person, because I think you'd really like her. No more unselfish wishes now. Try another.</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">I wish my waist was smaller!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Much better! Be an example, Boobsong, make a wish!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess your handmaiden wishes you were naked!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That's still a pretty altruistic thing to wish on an exhibitionist like me! (pluck...)</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">You can like it if you want but your handmaiden wished it so she could feel your sexy legs more!</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">I wish for a friend like Boobsong! Has she got a sister?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I thought you'd never ask. Unless <i>you're </i>an exhibitionist it's time for your collegaues to go have their nervous breakdowns now. Tell us when they're gone.</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Okay, it's just us three now. What have I got into?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Exactly what you wanted.</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">I want so many things--and you have something that can put them all together into a person just like Boobsong. The dream-seed-people from the story aren't a metaphor.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Of course not, how mean and boring would that be!? You did the right thing wishing, but it didn't happen yet or we'd know it. It might <i>not </i>happen with me watching. That's okay. This is vulnerable, and you're used to being in a place where everyone's always cutting themselves with Occam's Razor to make sure they can get traction and funding. You don't have to become credulous, but that's not going to help you here. Neither is being cool. From here out till your wish is granted everyone here is completely ridiculous, but me most of all. I mean, check this out: hey Boobsong, who's named <i>Boobsong</i>, what's your tail like?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Hehe it has buttons to control your cocksleeve shaped just like the ones your favorite remote control toy robot had when you were seven! It's suuper very kinky because it doens't just move your cocksleeve's muscles, it actually makes her think she has to do stuff.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">You're a shapeshifter, and I didn't put you up to it, why would you wear <i>that!?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Because you really really like it!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It still makes me blush but she's totally right. Why's your name Boobsong, anyway?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">When you couldn't sleep in your own bed the first time because you always had your nursemaid watch you in your cradle your handmaid sang you pretty music softly and you said her name is soft-song and then you got much older and we made it sexy!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'd still never sleep a wink without you. Being alone in bed is the <i>worst.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">You had her as a child?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She's my imaginary friend from when I was four.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">(the Dreams last-minute nudge me to say the different number)</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">Holy catchphrase can I have my friend--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh: the black mirror disappears and our memior comes back.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Congratulations, little one!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">EEE Happy Heartforming Santa! Congratulations Princess!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Fizzfreezing g<i>ot you.</i>&nbsp;I cackle with glee.<i>&nbsp;</i>We snagged a&nbsp;<i>rationalist!</i>&nbsp;The Sugarfeast Fairy and her handmaiden Boobsong!<i>&nbsp;</i>To be&nbsp;<i>SANTA CLAUS-</i>-BWAHAHA that's why Santa comes down the chimney the chimney is where stuff goes after you increase its entropy too much for it to be useful to you anymore and she's here to reverse entropy!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This boss parade just keeps getting better.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me a a post-it, handmaiden--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Turn page eep yes here!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Guess what your part in Heartwarming is! All the other kids, I remember. We'll show them. We'll SHOW THEM ALL!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This post-it has a picture of a wreath ornament like Jones' tree farm used to give out. I start reading:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Windshield, white-grey sky, road. Big space inside. Bus. Nice, but full of handholds, not cushions. Mickey statue, rides and castle in the distance, we're at Disneyland and this is one of the buses that drive people between hotels and the parks. Boobsong is next to me. There's a wreath hanging from the windshield, the sky is grey because it's Heartwarming! Heartwarming lights glow around the edges of the windshiled too.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's a mic in my hand? We turn around and face the busful of people as the bus gets underway. They look a bit zombied, like the blah weather's inside them.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I clap my hands together with the mic in them and inhale deeply--no no no self what are you doing make&nbsp;<i>Boobsong</i>&nbsp;sing if there needs to be singing--gaaaaasp in squeaky girly SIGH.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh, hehe. A few smiles, the kids like it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Hey everyone," I Eeyore at them. "Happy grey old Sunday. Not so sunny, is it? Oh well. Want to see some magic?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Earnest yesses from the kids and one adult in back who's remembered how to live.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I said do you want to see some MAGIC!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Louder yessing.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I don't knooooow...."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A few voices, and one kid:</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Princess Starlight you're my favorite!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Boobsong shows me a vision, targeting crosshairs on the kid who said it. I point and raise the mic.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"You, with the mouse-cap, because you made me happy I'll do magic."</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Why'd I make you happy!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The kid shouts it from the back.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"You said Princess Starlight's your favorite, and she's my favorite too. You know why?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A few kids shake their heads.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Because I'm the real Princess Starlight."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The bus goes rainbow-glowing as I unfold my wings and stomp my foot make images of beautiful many-petalled flowers explode from everwhere, then whip up a tornado of toonshaded rainbow streamers and make them festoon everything. I can feel the concentration it takes to hold the thin-air holograms together, not much, but some.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Instant applause, and it cuts me right through like any kind of praise does, I can feel my face trying not to cry.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Thank you! Now, who'd be happy as a fun new color? Here we are, get ready!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I put my hands up and spew a huge splash of liquid color, but it splashes off an invisible wall right in front of us and sloshes away to just make the weirdly big front area crazy-colored.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Ooops! I forgot the color wall! You'll have to come up past it when the bus stops."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The mixture of disappointment and relief is hilarious, as is the expression of the Chad Dad in the back row who thinks this is totally awesome and can't wait to get ridiculous. He's ending up hot pink from head to toe unless he's&nbsp;<i>very&nbsp;</i>specific.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I can make it last just about an hour, so don't be scared."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess you forgot something!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"What's that--candychomping sugar-eggs, I got the wrong holiday! It's Heartwarming, not Sugarfeast!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I can feel my eyes widen in fake horror at this "embarrassing" mistake. I'm looking at Boobsong now, and she's gazing up from under a black leather elf-hat rimmed with silver tinsel instead of white fur, looking very seriously cutely urgent. I loved seeing her with the little boom mic she had in front of her face.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I breathe in all dramatic with a cute "aaaaAAAAAH" then blow at the decorations with all my spluttering might, and turn them into Heartwarming garlands and ornaments.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">As I bbblow, Boobsong takes off down the aisle shaking the strings of sleigh bells in time to my bouncing and the bus driver pounding the rhythm on the steering wheel.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Most of the audience is raptly checking out my holograms or busy being handed jingle bells by the&nbsp;<i>real&nbsp;</i>Lyra, but a few of them are looking out the windows and noticing that we seem to be on a runway--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><br></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Gaaaaaaaasp air to sing with "JINGLE BELLS--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--and flooring it--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The driver is in a Santa costume, of course, a good one.&nbsp;<i>Really</i>&nbsp;good.&nbsp;This&nbsp;<i>is</i>&nbsp;Disneyland, after all.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I mean, it's truly great, just totally convincing, almost bwaha as good as my Starlight Princess costume.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She adjusts her glasses, sings along with the rest of the bus, stands in her seat, then matter-of factly pops the steering wheel off its column, tosses it over her shoulder, and somehow whistles sharply with a gloved hand. Antlers pass the bus on both sides, easily catching up and running in front.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I raise one leg up for a big stomp and hold my hands out and stomp hard and Boobsong is under me in pony-form, neatly filling that weirdly big front area.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Sorry to jet," I Fox McCloud at our audience perfectly.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess you forgot something! How can we fit out the door like this?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Santa's&nbsp;<i>ho ho ho&nbsp;</i>has a definite edge of&nbsp;<i>muahahaha&nbsp;</i>as she yanks a ratchety-sounding lever and the top half of the bus starts folding away to turn it into the&nbsp;<i>open&nbsp;</i>sleigh it always had to be. Wind buffered by aetherwork picks up while we wait there looking dramatic with my hair starting to blow around my face. I turn the mic upside down, flip a switch on it, stuff it into a pocket on my skirt, reach forward to touch Boobsong's nose, there's an every-wavelength flash, and the the sleigh fills with purple light, then falls out from under us as I kick Boobsong and she spreads her wings so the wind grabs us. She wheels, I can just barely see the reindeer stretching out in front of the sleigh through the fog that's come like from nowhere, and she pushes us ahead with a mighty flap.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"--but I have to navigate. See you all at Sugarfeast!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I shout the words down to everyone as the sleigh turns and falls behind and we take our place at the front of the line. We can't see because we're focused on where we're going, but this will be the part where the sleigh lifts off, because we're not landing to gallop.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Ahead, a chaos of hearths and grates and woodstove doors is visible, but all seen from the&nbsp;<i>inside, looking out</i>--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><b>"PRAH!"</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Santa filling stockings. Santa jumping down a chimney with her sack, coming out of a fireplace and inspecting milk and cookies. Santa with her sack checking out a really epic Heartwarming tree. How does she deliver presents to everyone in a single night? Easy. She's got a friend who's good at being everywhere people are making the same wish she's made before at once, and the knack for working with it. Her stripey-socked, shiny-green-suited elf running presents back and forth between a tree and Santa getting them out of her sack--so cute, she looks just like Freddie!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">With a blink of snowy-sparkling with teariness eyes, we're back on the whaleship.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--Boobsong doing up my snowpants in the family room in Stamford, and tying my boots because we're about to go out sledding, the excitement of Heartwarming when you're twelve hangs in the air, she poings up smiling and turns to get the door for me, her silver hair catching the white of the snow through the window--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Another breifing screen!?</p>
