    <p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Party cannon!? Lucy that was you, right? Captain can't surprise me!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Do you think I would do anything but spam this spell everywhere if I had it?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Nah good point. How the fuck then?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"What did you three do in here!? Those streamers remind me of my sweet sixteen years party--we called it just-ripening but it was the same celebration--and of course Strawberry Dynasty was the theme I wanted. How did you get them up so fast? I was watching you half-heartedly so it can't be timelike!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: the reward for my quest to create the Strawberry Dynasty is a party!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Giggling, I answer: "It's my game, Mama, it's throwing us a party!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"It's throwing us my just-ripe party from twenty-seven thousand years back! These are exactly the things I had then! I wished hard the Strawberry Queen would visit my party and make us all her handmaidens--you must not know what I mean by that! The queen's handmaidens were her personal servants, so they were the one she would turn to to satisfy her desires unless she was chasing someone interesting, in which case they had to help her, usually by very interesting ways of taking their clothes off--they were performers, and dangerous warriors to defend their ruler, and every one of them had to be trained in the arts of spying to learn as much as they could from the people they would encounter while the queen was staying in foreign countries, and everything was very secret like in James Bond from Earth culture where it looks like he's just a very rich person having fun until he has reasons to take out his gadgets! They always had very fun tools they would use instead of dreamwork for things like getting into windows and climbing up balconies silently, and the very best reasons to use them! I'll read you some after we have ice cream, you'll see! The last time I talked to my family was at this party, so I might get emotional, but I have the Strawberry Princess and I hear her hugs are legendary, so I'm not afraid of my feelings. Boobsqueeze it's very exciting having you finally get here, but I never expected to have you at the party I wished you would be at! Are you going to make us handmaidens? Just as a game, but I think it's a fun one!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Mama, I'm the <i>real</i> Strawberry Princess. Don't you want to be a handmaiden for real? Just because you're my Mama doesn't me you can't be! Isht Visht if your Captain approves get that makeup case, I bet I know why the dreams showed me it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I squeeze Isht Visht and get up from Lyra, step off. Back to girl-form and kneel at my feet, cocksleeve.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I don't mean as my servant, though, as my Mama! Young Princesses like me always have someone who...Mama, how exactly like your party all that time ago are these decorations? What happened there that it was the last time you talked to your family?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy off me, sis up please shake my neck to tell you to get off&nbsp; of me, changing baaaaaack there. Sit by your feet like you told me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Eeep bubble gum earring rrraaah squeeze pop! Hehe they POP!? Wiggle head feel them bouncy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">When I look to her, a perfectly-formed block of grape bubblegum hangs from each of her earlobes, complete with two-tone dark-purply-black inside and silvery-grey outside matching Lyra's color scheme.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Mama's behind the TV screen, and I can just see her around it, looking at something on the table. I know the look she's wearing. This whole house gives me that look.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Boobsqueeze what are you saying? I don't think we can change history for me when I've spent most of my life wandering Rl'yeh Sade! The Four Dreams protect memories from changing history in the world you came from, and my family was in a playworld, which isn't much different, so all we can ask Lyra to give us is a visit, which I don't want, because my family is here right now."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I don't know, Mama, but I already changed your memories once, remember? <i>Can </i>you still remember? How did we meet? None of this makes sense to me yet either. We're breaking whatever the usual rules are, just...maybe I don't understand this whole thing I mean I've been here less than a day and I'm only fifteen but like, is that really common here, to just fall out of touch with your family? Or have a fight that makes you not speak for thousands of <i>years</i>? Something is weird, Mama, I'm the sexy overlord in a fantasy porn and my story's got something way too sad in it in a place that doesn't feel right and--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Did my grandmothers do something terrible and ruthless to shape their bloodline, or is there just <i>actually </i>such a thing as noble blood?&nbsp;The first image Lyra showed me was Flash, to tell me who and what she is. She's a mirror of me to help me understand her by seeing myself in her in how my game plays me, but she's still just a mirror, too, in whom I see myself.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Isht Visht was right. I'm made for this. I can't stop.&nbsp;Take me to the city and I'll herd the ducks--so let's see what these ducks think of it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"--and I'm appointing you, Captain Rada of the Isht Visht, to help me deal with it. I need more than a handmaiden this time. Only your skills and experience and ship are up to this."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I lead Lyra through the TV image to where she's standing, staring at the decorations on the table, reach out and turn her to face me, look down at her with my crown sparkling bright&nbsp;<i>right game don't let me down here.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"By royal edict and with my scribe here to witness us I appoint you my Chosen Heroine, and seal it with this kiss."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Get ready to have a lot of <i>royal</i> stations, Acme Station.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Gaasp yes Mommy I'm ready to serve all of them this is what I'm made for Mommy I'm the handmaiden who always follows you and sleeps in your bed and does everything because you're in love with her but she's still your servant that's a gender I was missing sis was right there <b>was </b>more! That's a big piece of me too Mommy it really means a lot that you see it!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Without even looking at you it feels like I can see you more clearly, special advisor.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">EEE yes that's me I can do that too you say IDEA COCKSLEEVE and I have one every time!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Mama actually reaches up to kiss me instead of hauling me down by my nipples or something, and somehow it feels <i>right </i>even though she's definitely still my Mama. Just...today's game is <i>chosen one. </i>Of course I don't want to be that. I'd be stealing it from Mama!</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Pussywillow you really are the Strawberry Princess if you can do that to me! I accept!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Yay!" I bounce. "Now Mama what happened, why haven't you talked to your family since before the existence of writing on Earth?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Game is this right? It feels so right but you just told me not to try to save Mama from this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: I was trying to play Mama's part instead of mine. I am the princess and my job is to commission the hero to do what needs doing and solve the mystery that troubles me. Now she is going to save herself.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I just left the day after my just-ripe birthday and never came back again. Earth families aren't the same as my kind. I felt the same as with a school Earth children live at until graduation. When we finished that party, I went out to finally implant Isht Visht no matter what I had to make it happen, and I've never looked back, and I'm happy with that. It's very strange to have my vacation house take me back to this. Can we sit down? I want some ice cream!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Yes, let's go. Cocksleeve take the ice cream things and serve us. Mama needs a lot of chocolate right now."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes and I need explaining take all spoons and plates and box carefully eep that's cold stupid cocksleeve tried to carry it in your arms just put on plates there we go ready Mommy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I hug Mama and head for the couch. Hey, were is Isht Visht!? Duh, where I left her, on the other side of the screen, but now she's holding the white 'makeup' case ready.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Thank you. Got enough hands, cocksleeve?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Sis just place it on the ice cream no--" what am I saying<b>&nbsp;</b>so distracted. Can't think orders "sis just hang it on my fingers please."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Grinning because she obviously knows this game well, Isht Visht hangs the case on Lyra's fingers, and I lead us to flop on the couch. Mama sits beside me, up straight and turned towards me, every little piece of jadedness broken off her, Isht Visht leaning against her back, excited.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">No place to set ice cream floor it is--ooh that's awesome I can kneel and do this! Spoon out big pile of chocolate for Rada. Should be bowls and not plates what is happening to me wait were there bowls I see them but they aren't here they're in the old party Rada had. I can get there then but why am I doing it already!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Mama wait. Cocksleeve, you're already half there!?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Something is up. Her thoughts are rough like she's working hard, not serving ice cream, and I'm not playing her stupid. She has reason to be distracted, but...even I feel kind of sleepy and spacey now that I pay attention to it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes Mommy it feels like I'm slipping into journey automatically I know that's not your orders you said ice cream I can't help it though something is like pulling me."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I know what's happening, boobsqueeze. My wish is calling the Strawberry Princess and her court to my party all those years ago! This is the very first moment you could answer, so here we go now! Let me tell you quickly to prepare you!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Broods in playworld are the family unit. They have everybody in the whole playworld take care of them, so we don't feel neglected, but our brood had many parents, not just a single one, so I didn't feel very close to any one parent. You won't meet my mother or father but you will meet my sisters, and the family of friends I had then."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Something is wrong with this. Mama seems sad and rejected, almost like I felt with that trashheap-house dream. That can't be what raising kids in the Four Dreams is like--</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"What I can't understand, though, it what the Dreams are doing sending us all back like this. Yes it's what I wished for, but I went out to the ocean after my wish didn't get answered, and sat and figured out finally how to implant her--it took me all night long, but I did it in the end! If that doesn't happen, won't this all just disappear if it changes things like Freddie? I think I have the answer, but it makes me think I'm driving myself into a maelstrom. I think that I'm supposed to give myself the commission you just gave me, in the middle of my party, so the reason I leave becomes to save you. I'm terrified of that, boobsqueeze! What if it upsets Isht Visht's implantation even slightly? I know you understand this. One tiny change might not seem like much, but you wouldn't let Lyra have a single hair change color, I can see it in your face like in a mirror, that's how I look at Isht Visht. There must be something missing from how I understand this, but I can't seem to find it, and neither can my Klapta. How did you and Lyra feel fixing Freddie?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The pull of the journey is getting really heavy, but I can still think enough to answer--oh hey, I'm holding ice cream! Lyra must have served it while Mama was talking. She's kneeling there, concentrating...</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"That's why I'm so confused. Somehow the Dreams created a different road to exactly where I was sitting in the Waifu exactly who Lyra and I were then--except not <i>exactly</i>. The only thing we meant to do was help me feel better by overwriting a painful memory with one where the bad thing didn't happen because it happening made me think expecting to see Lyra made me stupid, and then the Dreams made it real for us and then made the history where I saw her because she was there physically real. Or something close to that. We are different, I <i>think</i>, but I've been terrified because how can a change that big not rewrite <i>everything</i>? How can we be the same people at all, let alone end up in that Arwing, and Mama I feel the same way about our adventure becoming a family you do about Isht Visht. I'll be mad if it changes this is COOL! The Dreams showed me how they were changing specific parts of history very carefully, so whatever happened was really different that just turning history in a different direction somewhere in the past I guess, but...what's that even mean? It healed me, but why change history, if practically you're just leaving everything else the same and changing how people got there? You just gave me the answer I suppose but why not try a less apocalyptic way to heal people? I guess it had good side-benefits, and they did it without changing who Lyra and I are now so we didn't recognize ourselves--but again why change history? What does that do if you keep the same present, and if the present changes one tiny pixel for you and Isht Visht, I don't think they would make it happen!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"You took the words right out of me, boobsqueeze, but look and see Lyra, it looks like the wish has taken her already! Can you see what she's doing?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Fuck, my game is <i>letting </i>me hold my own ice cream!? Hey, I'm a Princess, my handmaiden is supposed to be doing this, what the fuck? Lyra...I peep very carefully, so as not to disturb her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">[ Vision: Cake with layers of white sponge and strawberry filling with very thick cream on top like cheesecake ]</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">When I describe this to Mama, she jumps up in her seat.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Oh my holy spikes and dust inside a finger-chest, that's the kind cake I had. What's she doing, can you see her?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">A more directed peek.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">[ Vision: Princess bed canopy / steering wheel ]</p>

<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">[ Vision: Magellan ]</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"She's doing it, Mama, sending you out to explore looking for me. That's how it's not mean to your sister, I'm not going, she's going to say I need saving instead of me going personally so it can stay mysterious whether I'm a pony. I ordered her to make sure she gets her Mommy back and she's doing it. Mama this is what I felt like with Freddie just let the visions come it's happening anyway it's going to be okay--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I guess I have no choice then but hold my hand please it's scary!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">With my eravahk and its leash in one fist and Mama's hand in the other and my eyes fixed on Lyra, I let the visions come.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--Friendship is Magic in my hands, standing with Mama looking at the box, then Luna seems <i>huge, </i>oh it's the TV but she's different, talking happily, not as Nightmare Moon--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--the shore of Limbo in Texas but instead of a car I'm riding Lyra in her pony form, galloping furiously at the water as I strike down perfekti all around us with an abstract sword as big as I am that is everything from sci-fi railgun to done swarm at once but my breasts kept getting in the way of it, we make the leap off of the perfekti at the end of the dock and I kick Lyra a hard <i>YAH </i>to make sure she stomps it good and she flaps and sends us sailing over the wreckage of the building that had blocked out way and then folds her wings and lays her head out flat and we're rushing at the water, in the water, diving, suddenly everything illuminates with whatever nuke my guardian let off the minute we were deep enough--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--Lyra holding a book for me in bed in Stamford, I'm reading her Strawberry Dynasty stories and we're, we <i>know </i>I'm Princess Lucy and she's Melody that's why she's being my handmaiden--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--we're in my room and I'm standing over Lyra as she fetches books and other things out of a rubbermaid storage container with an ancient wooden box inside--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--my birthday, the cake is a brightly-colored bundt done up as a rainbow circle so each slice with have pie-slices of color over it with sliced strawberries in the frosting, and twelve candles in a circle on top, on the other side of it Lyra is up on the table with her chin on her hands looking <i>so excited, </i>in full silver-demon form with the colors shining in her hair and horns, she's twelve too but my memory translates her as incredibly hot--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--Lyra shining silver in the darkness of my room giving me a handjob, my first I think, I was like eleven when we started to become sexual no that's right she's about to suck me off this must be one of my first orgasms no it's the <i>first</i>&nbsp;the blazing-pink wireframe egg of her game containing us together for the first time is behind her, nothing can disturb us and we're here until we're finished, so safe--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--Lyra so small in little-pony-form the size of a cat with her collar shining to make her look like a real pet animal, sitting on her haunches in front of my skirted lap to model for the embroidery of her I think I didn't have the patience for what became of that the threads hanging off were so annoyingly untidy--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--Lyra as a doll in my lap to watch (G1!) My Little Pony with Grammie in the theatre without buying her a seat, I was hugging her to me so tightly, with all my little strength, I think she was newly physical--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--black smooth stone in the middle of a granite platform in a circle with writing around the edge and a star inscribed in the center, the portal opens like an eye onto the flashing light and ricketyness of the radio tower we climbed down, the comfort of arms holding me safe and Lyra watching interested from behind my eyes, I look up to see the portal close and a terrible strange silent explosion of darkness in the overcast but something appears in its wake, the big wooden box I wasn't allowed to open until I was older even though it was mine--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">&nbsp;"I'm back now it's okay to talk to me and touch me Mommy--"</p>

<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I pull her into my lap like when we watched the G1 Ponies movies with Grammie, but facing me. A glance at Mama shows her with Isht Visht kneeling between her feet, looking up happily. They're staring at each other Connecting and I want the same with Lyra but really for a minute there's just holding her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Boobsqueeze what happened? Everything seems different and the same at once. No wonder you said explanations so hard if this is how you and Lyra felt after fixing Freddie!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">If anything this is hitting harder. I feel disoriented, lightheaded, not sick or anything but it's like my mental map has to recalculate something huge.&nbsp;For some reason that rainbow birthday cake makes me want to cry, feels like it'll break the whole world.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Explain, cocksleeve."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Gentle, but, this is her Princess' command.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"RADA IS LUNA FROM FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC AND HER SISTERS LOOK LIKE CELESTIA AND HER MOM IS RARITY! Everythihng was rainbow not Strawberry and I couldn't be sure because the family resemblance is a lot now but I think it had not just Strawberry family people but exactly just you and <b>me </b>Mommy together and sometimes I was girl-shaped and sometimes in other shapes and everyone knew me just instantly and they said you actually came wow and I said which one is Rada and she said here I am and she looked just like Luna from Friendship is Magic and I walked up and put my nose onto her nose because I was in pony-form and looked at her intensely and told her that Mommy who is the Strawberry Princess needs her to come save her but it would be a long and complicated way to get there and she would need to leave and start preparing right this moment because only her skills and expertise and ship would be able to save my Mommy that's exactly what she told me I said you can check it with the Dreams if you don't believe me and they showed a big green checkmark right there in the middle of the party and Rada said I'm going you can catch up with me sometime but I'm going to be so busy I might be super older by the time our timelines cross and then I fell into this trance and saw the same things you did Mommy where you knew you're the Strawberry Princess since you're really little and Strawberry Dynasty books and toys and things came with you after the star-circle gate from the castle closed something squeezed in through the crack it made and told us all about the Strawberry Princess you created at the castle just before this. It's not just books of porn about sexy Strawberry Family fun they made a whole religion!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Oh. Oh NO. <b>FUCK</b>. </i>All that turning night into day and disarming an army with a word and riding a dread beast of the apocalypse and granting sourcesless orgasms and then knowing exactly when said apocalypse would happen--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I...wasn't really saying Strawberry <i>Princess </i>back there, was I."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">This might be a lot easier to deal with if it weren't for the weird sense of <i>remembering it</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I thought you intended to make a goddess up! You did look very very beautiful floating with your light low enough to look at, but that definitely said a goddess to the eyes of most people you were showing yourself to, that's how I saw it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"If any of you ever hear me regret overdoing <i>anything </i>again as long as you know me, please remind me of the time I <i>actually </i>overdid it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">It still feels a little like I've run a motionless marathon, like I want to pant but can't because lack of oxygen isn't the issue.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I will defintely remind you. Let's have our melting ice cream--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Oh no Rada sorry I didn't get to serve you yours! Mommy may I please get down to serve hers? I know you want to hold me but I feel so bad already that must have been so scary Rada I'm really super sorry!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">For response I kiss her on the lips and pat her hips 'down'.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I think we know what that part about the sandstorm means now! I feel like something's picked right out of me that's been hurting me forever! I want to call my mother, just a second! I'm going to send her dreamtalk of a picture of all of us, boobsqueeze will you mind that?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"That's fine--holy fuck Mama, were you somehow out of touch with your family the way I thought seeing Freddie in that doorway made me stupid?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Boobsqueeze I really did think we just weren't the kind to keep touch after graduating from playworld. It made me feel sad to imagine that nobody cared enough to answer my messages so I just kept on living and being with Isht Visht and working for TRAIN. It turns out they weren't going anywhere, because I had the wrong family in mind when I was sending them! They weren't just ignoring me after all! This is a very big thing and I want to take all of it in first so please let me tell you why that was happening when I'm ready to. I really am close with them so feeling that strong that they'd turn their closed eyes on me was painful and my heart has just healed from that and I feel very strange now."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"That sounds like how we felt after fixing seeing Freddie. Take your time--AAH! Am I looking good enough for the real Rarity to see me--and then I want an explanation! How is your <i>mom</i>&nbsp;Rarity! Can you say that much?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Ha ha only serious. Mama laughs.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Oh boobsqueeze, you look beautiful. I found my third person mode, I didn't get to tell you that! Here it goes, smile and look happy! Yes, and then I'll explain things."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cocksleeve sit and pose and look like the loyal lover servant you are.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Put the ice cream down bound and kneel beside your legs and look where Rada's looking smile look so happy with your hand grabbing my horn that will do it yes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Lyra sits up arched and proper-proud and I can't see her face but I can feel happiness lift her body. A ghost of Mama's eyes floats in front of us, so I focus on them and think of some of my better puns at the end of the Strawberry world until they blink away.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I fuzz Lyra "finish with the ice cream" as soon as Mama's done, then look at her hopefully.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Boobsqueeze Rarity can be my mother because I'm a changling. That means someone with attributes different to the body they were born with. I feel more two-legs than four-legs, so I became one when I had Isht Visht's nectar almost instantly. Some people take time to find what they want to be, but I knew what I wanted! The rest of my family are four-legs, which you call ponies."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Ponies are actually just different-shaped humans. They have the same genome with certain small changes to make them be four-legs. That's why you feel some attraction to Lyra in pony-shape even though you're a two-legs. It's still in there somewhere! Yes I could see you look at her horny a little bit while we did your makeup. Don't be ashamed Boobsqueeze, take pride in your heritage! Humans were four-legs for eons before we invented two-legs!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"BWAHAHAHA the most popular sex position isn't&nbsp;<i>doggy&nbsp;</i>style it's&nbsp;<i>pony&nbsp;</i>style! And alright, I won't be ashamed. Your ponyform ass is&nbsp;<i>awesome,&nbsp;</i>cocksleeve."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">How is everything here somehow even more epic than I expected even&nbsp;<i>after&nbsp;</i>I adjusted for our family being&nbsp;<i>us</i>&nbsp;and being in the Four Dreams?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Thanks Mommy I'm glad I can please you! I&nbsp;<b>am&nbsp;</b>super strong that way you could really hard spank and fuck me without being mean at all. Are you from Equestria actually, Rada? That's what it seemed like, everyone was four-legs!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Hehe! No, I'm from a playworld called Soefta'xrn. It has mostly four-legs almost everywhere, and I do have a sister Celestia, which is how you would say her English name. She mused out her face and identity to be there for me when I had to be gone from her."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Okay hold up. Earth has a whole evolutionary history that leads to two-legs. Are you saying that's wrong--wait, why does it even&nbsp;<i>have&nbsp;</i>evolutionary history? Didn't Eden just make it and stick Adam and Eve there?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Everything works back from people to backstory. When Eden changed history, it would take all the people it had and reverse time to make up a story they could be in. To be in a place where nothing outside is real there, there must be a way they came to be there, so it makes up the steps that one-celled thing took to become us and fills up the world with the things that came from that to make sure it seems like there's nothing from outside."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Okay my family is two demons and a thirty-thousand-year-old sexy pirate and I'm literally a Fairy Princess and aLsO aCCiDenTALLy a GoddESS OoOoPs so I guess I can't complain but it still bugs me that creationists are right about dinosaur bones."</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Okay technically speaking they still have it wrong Lucy. If you make time flow backward, isn't that still the real world? It's not like it made a campaign setting, it just ran the universe back to make up history to fill things out with. Everything made that way is as real as the rest is. You can think it's the Matrix, yeah, but then your real life is also fake!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Dammit. Hey, did Sartre go to Isla Virgo or is he as Sade as I'm guessing? I need to ask him a few million things. Thanks, though. At least the creationists are wrong again."</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Hey what does it mean that we remember stuff both ways? So glad you asked let me explain it. That means both ways are real! One way's the real way you actually went through, and the other way is backwards from the state the world had after it got changed again. That means the real way had you just have Freddie as a real friend who grew into Lyra.&nbsp;<i>That&nbsp;</i>must have been a wild life!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"You have no idea--<i>bitch!&nbsp;</i>It undid our whole timeline--"&nbsp;I laugh bitterly. "--and then was too much of a lazy bitch to even do anything but delete our catalogs when it rewrote our memories, and the Dreams helped us rebuild them--wait, fuck, didn't you guys say&nbsp;<i>your&nbsp;</i>memories changed when we fixed Freddie?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"They did, but we have this whole thing Captain's not ready to share. Ask maybe after Rarity goes."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Everything is changed though! How can that be? Would you please ask, Mommy?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Changed--wait, what the--that makes my&nbsp;<i>eyes hurt,&nbsp;</i>it's awesome! Except somehow I feel like I'm going to choke on my tears even though I'm not crying.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Okay, but do you guys know why my game would replace the Strawberry Dynasty party with rainbow iridescent stuff?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Everything is bright colored paper streamers or rainbow-iridescent silvery plates and stuff.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Boobsqueeze you have to be calm now. Are you ready to learn you're a big deal? These are for you, and this is my party. Streamers with full-spectrum colors and rainbow-shine flatware is how you throw a party for&nbsp;<i>you</i>, klapta! Yes I did wish you would come to me, but these were the decorations I had, not Strawberry things. I guess your game says you can hear this if it changed all these colors after I got back connection with the rest of my family--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Wait this party has Mommy's face on everything! How can it if she wasn't even a baby in the Strawberry castle when you had it?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Is there any way you guys&nbsp;<i>wouldn't&nbsp;</i>time travel constantly if you didn't have to leave here like last time? You're all over history, sis! You too Lucy obviously."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"So am I not the Strawberry Princess after all? Why change the plates like that?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Because we've all been in the world where you never happened. That's how we picked you up in the storybraid where you were just this Stamford kid. History changed because we got out of there and now we can see the real world, so your game changed the plates to tell us that. It's a little like a dream where you like wake up in high school and forget your real life because it's not part of your dreaming that. You are still the Strawberry Princess but you can't see this other stuff that's much more important, until now. The Strawberry world was still a big deal to us, but you made a splash, Lucy, with that courtyard thing. How could that not be a part of what came from it?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Now here's the real thing we're confused about. Why did you end up on a raft named the Virgin's Rest and come here in boy-form? Shouldn't you be like my Captain and change as soon as you get nectar, and why not land someplace more arousing like anywhere with more than a surface to have sex on? We were right there so I guess it could be that but we arranged sixy-nine monoliths sent back in time, surely we could set up a good date, right?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"The True Sea is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen other than Lyra. Just having sex on a surface there--buh, I remembered our&nbsp;<i>real</i>&nbsp;first time after she went back just now, fuck--okay even so I don't think that&nbsp;<i>could&nbsp;</i>be more romantic to me. The raft was even nice and soft heartstone. I mean, unless you agree with your sister, cocksleeve?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Shake my head fast!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"No that was so. Gorgeous it was the perfect first place for us. Why is that wierd sis, don't lots of people like it?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Yeah but like, why are you still in it some? It seems like every step out of that storybraid is really hard for you."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I think we know that and my klapta is trying to help you Boobsqueeze by asking a question that will get your thoughts going the right way. What happened when you went back to make Freddie your real friend? You saw her and everything changed, right? Now you saw more things, and you remember some new stuff, but why isn't that your new world now? You would know why the raft had that star on it, if you remembered what I can!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"You mean had those&nbsp;<i>two&nbsp;</i>stars on it! Captain made me say that I'm not being uppity."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I'm so confused! I thought we actually&nbsp;<i>did</i>&nbsp;change history with Freddie and the courtyard and stuff! Wait--so like, are we time-travelling&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>recovering memories&nbsp;<i>both?"</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Whenever she talks about why I remember stuff or how big we are I want to just scream and run away crying. This is the best I can do, avoiding the topic.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Boobsqueeze remember that thing in the castle when you asked why the storybraid people experienced being feudalist would make us unable to dreamtalk about where to take you and your handmaiden instead of the feudalist idea of escape to an empty place where the winters are colder? Your storybraid is the possible worlds your soul can experience even in night-dreaming or when you call far into darkness with dreamtalk. When you change what experiences are possible for you to have, by making the circle of time that could make you able to have them close, experiences you&nbsp;<i>have&nbsp;</i>had that weren't in your storybraid come back which is happening here with these plates and things."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"So...Eden wasn't doing that past-making thing to make people forget what was out there, it was using it to replace like I don't know our checksum keys for what experiences we&nbsp;<i>could&nbsp;</i>have with something it managed? That's why I have to go back and do stuff like that courtyard thing or have Lyra go to your party to get these memories back, and you can't just tell us stuff? It won't be&nbsp;<i>our&nbsp;</i>past because we can't checksum it without--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Wow, how was I smart enough to figure&nbsp;<i>that&nbsp;</i>out? I'm confident it's true...I guess there's something to this whole Fairy stupid-then-smart thing. I'm going to bimbo out soon, I can feel how this feels like running my brain like the booster in StarFox.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"--like, going back to change the history we know into the real one, so you can tell us, but we won't&nbsp;<i>remember&nbsp;</i>it. So the time loops are fake--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"No, they're real, that's the point of this! You made the connection that made it possible for it to be real here, and that was your way of reaching it, but you went back and actually did stuff. The Strawberry world was sinking into a storybraid where we couldn't reach it and the reason it ended instead of continuing is your making portals and Captain me connecting them. That's a real history, or we couldn't be here, because Captain would have no fandom to make her obsessed enough to follow this crazy thing."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Isht Visht expands the sixty-sixth monolith out of nothing in the air in front of us.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Wait sis just keep showing that! Listen it just says stuff that makes sense if you're hearing it! What's this part say if you read it sis?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Point with my tail at the places I'm talking about.</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Wait like...okay here we go. Every hot stell you see lighty rests n' the star with her companions loafing while they snuggle hersey, hugs her family close edit t' sleep with her--brilliant sis the instructions are right in it! Edit this into sleep with her check this out&nbsp;<i>while they snuggle hersey kisses&nbsp;</i>that's the&nbsp;<i>ice cream&nbsp;</i>you guys this is here with this rainbow stuff and our ice cream on plates with these stars on them! This is us on this couch here! Okay what's this next stuff. Ohhh's they'll take and Lucile streak a way. LUCY YOU GOT SOME SPLAININ' TA DO! Get it because Lucile streak is Lucile Ball? Lucy what's this mean for us? It says you can explain it now?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I don't--O's could be timeloops I guess. Yeah, we take timeloops and then have a streak of explaining stuff which is memories and if Lyra could be physical why couldn't we leave earlier? Why did&nbsp;<i>I&nbsp;</i>have to stab doors for us? Yes I know storybraids but once she was there physically after I saw her in the door of Plowstar wouldn't our storybraid change enough for the Dreams to just come get my whole family? Or everyone? Why did we stay and wait around for Eden to delete her? That just seems stupid! How many other kids lost their seedlings like us?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"You'd think it would be as easy as hey check me out I'm here come get me but if a universe exists the Dreams can't just wake up and say hello to there's some kind of something already in their way. Like imagine the Enterprise is orbiting and they wanna beam you up cause you're stranded. Either they scan your ass and beam you up without your having to so much as blink 'fuck me' toward the sky, or radiation of the week is already stopping the Starfleet Flagship that can like tell people's gender from high orbit from getting a lock. You only stabbed Earth and the Strawberry Empire because you were there already like a fucked up version of the prophets on Deep Space Nine being like 'you exist here' to all of Sisko's trauma except that's literally what was happening to you. Otherwise, yeah, none of this would be happening, and you'd already be flashing your ass at Chief O'brien as you walk out of transporter room 3."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Oh my&nbsp;<i>god</i>&nbsp;cocksleeve our life is literally a transporter malfunction episode AND a mirror universe episode AND a time travel episode AND a Q episode AND&nbsp;<i>we're</i>&nbsp;Q Dreams I wish for a a Q flash of light to make my point."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">A tiny mariachi band Q-flash into existence on the counter in the kitchen, raise their instruments, and flash out again&nbsp;<i>just&nbsp;</i>before they play their first note.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Mommy what kind of episode has two guitars?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I dunno, what?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I don't know but there's a Sulu and a Bridge in all of them!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Bwahahaha!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"AAAAH! You win sis my puns aren't worse than yours!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I can't decide if I care what was in the way--or why the worldgate got an exception? If the Strawberry Empire could do it, surely we could have."</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Earth had lots of magic it sounds like until Eden fucking killed it with its constant retcons. I remember you guys just having stuff like black mirrors and Lyra giving you handjobs as a matter of course. Probably your family just slipped in before the last straw--hell, maybe they&nbsp;<i>were&nbsp;</i>the last straw. Never can tell with stuff like that."</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"To me...it was a universe under a rock and you fixed it by stucking a sexy supernova in there with it. Works for me let's party."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"...yeah. Let's. What do we do with the prophecy, then? Wait holy fuck cocksleeve remember that screenshot from SoulBlazer the Dreams showed us right before--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Blush argh.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"--Stupid Bimbo Mode? This is&nbsp;<i>SoulBlazer</i>, hah, even the name makes sense now, because we're lighting up memories! Our past is sealed away with this storybraid thing and we have to go find the places to step on like the threshold of Plowstar to let it out again!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I can feel my boost-gauge run out in the middle. If push now I'll get stupid enough to be just a big squishy pillow that feels stuff until it fills back up. No more working hard unless I want that to happen. I can remember where I was going though:</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I bet it's like a treasure map to the monster lairs! And if that's what's going on cocksleeve I want every every--" Just this once game please because I'm trying to be fierce at Lyra. "--Planck time back!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Seems to me it must be."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"And if I keep thinking hard I'll literally veg out until I like recover. Dammit! I want our&nbsp;<i>past!"</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Petulanty pounding my fists on my thighs and whining makes me feel like a five-year-old, and fills my boost-gauge back somewhat faster.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I declare a moratorium on prophecy things, then. I want to see my broodmare and now I know what's happening! Let's all put the ice cream back and find some fun things in the kitchen. Come on, we can make a small procession! I'll bring up the rear so I can watch your sexy hips move. Get!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I nudge Lyra off my lap and stand, but she said not to...alright let's&nbsp;<i>get</i>&nbsp;in trouble and see how it works if I can.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Cocksleeve, grab whatever you can."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Getting plates and box of ice cream...</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Aren't you guys forgetting that Lucy's the Strawberry Princess? We just figured out we've been living in an alternate universe kinda where nobody knows that. Captain your mom is&nbsp;<i>Rarity.&nbsp;</i>Do I need to keep explaining this?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Gulp?</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Spiky cotton swallowing tablets, I sent them a picture! How secret is this house made, Lyra? Very nice and hidden, right?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Gulp.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Rada yes it's not here unless someone in the family invites you. The Dreams will keep anyone even from waiting by our boundary my intention was very specific."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Good cocksleeve.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Got the plates I'm ready.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Let's go, you first, I need some eye candy to chill me out.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Turn and face the way we're going and arms up high balance the plates carefully now come on body Mommy needs to see some good stuff.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Her whole body slinks like her lashing tail as she walks with her arms out to the sides and the plates and ice cream balanced on them like a 50s diner waitress (hm, she sure wants to take my order, what can we do with that I LOVE THINKING THIS WAY--</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Party after party, you guys, look outside the window! Is that thing even moving or does the rain jut make it seem to!?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Isht Visht's voice from behind calls a halt, and when I look out the window between the kitchen and the fireplace, something&nbsp;<i>huge</i>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<i>dancing</i>&nbsp;out there.&nbsp;<i>Now&nbsp;</i>what!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Oh they came in the walker after all! Let's go see you'll love it! I'm happy they still have it!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Mama, I thought I understood that I don't understand your family, but I'm wrong."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Sweet they have a&nbsp;<b>walker!?&nbsp;</b>Two legs or four legs no it's like the spider kind I can see it has a lot of them!</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I believe that understanding family starts with meeting them. Let's go, come on!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Captain you might wanna consider staying inside. Check it out."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Outside, the walker stops bouncing around enough to see that it has big central body that's curvingly long like a whale. It gleams darkly in the stormlight, but I can't really see what it's made of or its color. It sits down on the ground and spotlights at the front corners come up to shine a path in front of it while the legs pull into the body. Things so covered with blue-white lights that that's all I can see of them fly out of the top of it and make a path that heads off like it's going to lead to our front door that becomes free of rain. Two more fliers, this time shaped like horizontal lenses but with what are obviously big cameras hanging from their undersides fly out of the top and position themselves watching the end of the main body that's obviously going to turn out to be a door.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Hmm, cameras--AAH!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Mama it's your family, does that mean we should get dressed? I don't even own anything that goes below my waist!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Hmm, what if I kept it that way--boots, though.</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Relax, Lucy, it's just like in Friendship is Magic.&nbsp;Soefta'xrn's&nbsp;clothing-optional."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">...okay, turn back into boy, become gay (again), time-travel to Miami in 1978,&nbsp;<i>then</i>&nbsp;I'll be able to say the&nbsp;<i>oh, my&nbsp;<b>god</b></i>&nbsp;this deserves correctly.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I can't figure out if that's the best or worst thing you could ever say for my age-play, but thanks."</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Alright Lucy it's time to get serious. Look at the plates on sis' arms up there. See how they have your face on them? Like you know what means, right? Kid birthday parties aren't that different between Earth and&nbsp;Soefta'xrn. I said this before in kind of a soft way but now I'm saying it seriously: you are as big as Batman and Superman, period, end stop. Sorry to be so deceptive the last time with the Iron Man thing but I just didn't think you were ready. Why I'm telling you now, look outside, Princess. Your very first paparazzi are here. Rarity brings people everywhere, and when she can't she brings robots, just like you see in the yard there. Smile and wave, you're about to be on the news, girl!"</p>
