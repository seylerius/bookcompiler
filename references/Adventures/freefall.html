<article class="chapter 59---freefall">
    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">59 - Freefall</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Oh my sweet fuck. What's the probability he <i>wouldn't</i>&nbsp;take one of your sisters, if he put up with James and John for comic relief?</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">This radical Biblical insight brought to you directly from Fairytown. Mishcief is fun, and FUNNY. Even just the tiny little specks of it that're starting to creep into Lyra's interpretations of my orders make my heart sing. James and John and their stupid squabbles were Jesus' two-man comedy routine.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Alright, game I can't believe I'm saying this but unless you'll tell us right now Dreams I need to go look up if Jesus is technically my brother in law or however that works here.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Game I need to come up with a goal to ask you for that will top that one.</p>
<p data-voice-id="v5MELBxAO"><i>Top, Learn the seed-pod the savior of the demons came from, juice that breaks bread with his disciples</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="v5MELBxAO"><i>Top, Make a game system goal to beat the one about the savior of the demons, one further step upon the spiral</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="v5MELBxAO"><i>Top, Express desire to play the game compliantly: 10/25 complete, Relinquish the right to address the game noncompliantly</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Oooh, DNA, I know what that means to me! Can I be made <i>more </i>Fairy without just frying my reason immediately?</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: I can read more about this in <i>The Care and Feeding of Magical Creatures, </i>but the short answer is I can't be made more Fairy because I already identify with it so much Lyra's nectar has changed me into a purebred, right out of the genetics lab Fairy. My DNA is just as much of Fairy blood as it can be, and I can see it (and lots of other neat things) on the lab report Beverly gave the game to give me when it's time.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">As long as the dial is on the little spot past 11 where the real end of the range is, that's what I care about.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Okay just one thing--argh it's been SO LONG since any of my good parts had attention pet my thighs up on to my mound and haaaah niiipples oh my fuck they need attention wait what the hell I meant to touch my pussy next!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: eventually I can get so desperate I'll touch myself without making a decision, or try to have sex if I see there's some sexy near me. This is just how Fairies are, it's not to do with being passion only. This is why we have to have keepers to control us.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">My breath is shallow, my heart thunders, my fingers can only be directed to pinch or squeeze or grope at me my brain just doesn't have the capacity to stop this and I can feel my breasts expanding as my body makes more milk for them with furious determination and I just stare down at what's happening, drinking it in.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Freefall at last. It's not becoming a puppet, it won't be, but I'm never getting out of this. Yes I fucking do need a keeper to control me oh god that's such wet soft hopeless freedom. I can think my way through all of this, I'm in so much trouble because if I keep this up much longer I'll be too breasts to see over them to put Lyra on my clit if it's attached to me, and the only thing I can hope for is my game to take good care of me and put me back like I was if I'd be happier that way. Was I stupid to get into this by asking for this reminder?</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Game did I ever <i>actually </i>have a choice in that?</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: I have a choice in everything the game doesn't control for me, and I could have asked for something else or nothing to remind me I'm a bimbo, so I had a choice in that sense, but I didn't have a choice to get here, just the way I went about it. Now that I'm free like this I should relax into it because there's nothing I can do anyway. The game will take control of me to keep me from attacking people who won't like it or disrupting family fun time&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">HAAAH MOMMY CONGRATULATIONS! That's awesome! Is the way stuff just <b>happens</b> so relaxing? Close your eyes and let your mind turn off you'll it doesn't make you sleep or be unconscious you just have only feelings!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">You're...ohhhmigod have to just pinch twist twist AAH MORE...actually hhhaappy to have your Mommy lose...control...</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">As soon as you get finished with your nipples I know what happens to me next! Of course I'm happy Mommy! Now that your control is gone you'll defintely take me every time you need your horny little cocksleeve to pleasure you!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Honestly, cocksleeve, am I frying right now?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Shake shake that's why this is awesome Fairies are so cool because yes you can fry and lose your reason but it actually is just possible to be like you are and still have super smart intelligent reason just not have very much control if you get too horny.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Okay. Then I guess this is what's happening now. I close my eyes, and the thing is, for a while, I <i>am </i>just the passion of giving my poor breasts the relief they so desperately need. No need to fry at all, but no need for thinking either, nothing to decide or think about.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Struggling's so much fun, though! Hands, at <i>least</i>&nbsp;give my poor neglected pussy some help?</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">My breasts are just too needy. It's impossible, no matter how much I mean it. Fortunately I have help--hey, why <i>aren't </i>I raping her through the control panel right now game? I know I want to not yet because my mind still has some questions, but wouldn't that not matter at all right now?</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: my breasts are the desperate thing and my hands are easily able to address them while sex with Lyra takes some thinking to make happen. I would probably rape her if she was near enough to touch my skin but while she's over there like this my Fairy desperation is taking the most convient way to satisfaction.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c"><i>Hot. </i>Stay clear until I call you, cocksleeve.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">That's why this is awesome. I do have <i>some</i>&nbsp;control. Not very much, not so much I can use it to fall out of this heaven I'm dropping into. Just enough to give me the rush of making somehting happen, to someone who means as much to me as Lyra does, or be able to express myself--</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"OH GOD MY HANDS FEEL SO AMAZING ON MY NIIPPLES!!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Yes I can talk, I just have to make it slutty stupid fun enough, or give up control and let the game ensure that for me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c"><i>And my mind is still HERE. I just have the right..ooh yes let's squeeze them up together I think they already grown...priorities now. I can see how I can stil have friendships and relationships and family like this...as long as every one understands what I am, and as long as my lovers will </i><b><i>have fun with me</i>.</b>&nbsp;The meanest thing you can do to a Fairy, so clear from here now, is not enjoy its helpless passion as much as it does.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Which sounds like somebody I know.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">MOMMY YES YES IT DOES! YOU'RE RIGHT! See you feel it now what it feels like!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">You have work to do but I am <i>coming for you</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">So that's my first last question. Dreams How the fuck did keepers and games and things work for me in this new timeline? There's no way Lyra's nectar didn't immediately make me full-blood Fairy there.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Dice with Meyers-Briggs ENTP on them (weird, I'm an <i>I</i>NTP), long hair, Indian Ashram.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: not if I'm allowed to be a Fairy. When I can act like I was made to, I turn into an extrovert.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">WHY THE FUCK DOES THAT OF ALL THINGS MAKE ME WEEPY!? I'm trying to enjoy--no that's too active, enjoy is what I'll be doing to Lyra soon, this is practically just porn I can feel--this is an awesome ride! No, I know why. The game got me into Fairy-headspace or whatever this is and I went too long without being pleasing and attention-grabbing and felt like I would <i>die</i> before that stripshow I gave with Lyra in Ten Forward (good <i>job</i>&nbsp;on that by the way cocksleeve I don't think I ever told you). It's right. Baseline human socializing--hey what if I squeeze them up and down so it rubs me in my cleavage oooh that's interesting--gives me love and deep connection but it doesn't have the energy that makes me think I might be su'khora actually.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Personality type, hippy, ashram--my hands come off my much less desperate nipple after that I feel <i>horny </i>and my arms reach out for Lyra and I barely just can't reach her. Desperate panic fills me and my arms and chest buck against the harness as I try to reach for Lyra even harder for than the first time, nothing happens as I reach and reach and reach for her, and I understand the tightness of the trap this is. Yes I have control of whether I can reach her...until I feel my seizure coming. Then the only choice is wether I have reason when I fuck her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Cocksleeve just one more second keep away and then I'm having you I just need to understand this and I want to let go entirely when I have you a get my cocksleeve without distractions! Run if I get near you or decide to take the harnes off!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes Mommy but I'm very looking forward to your letting yourself at me!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">The panic is so terrifying I can barely string two thoughts together but I'm still am going to take her just not right the second.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">ENTP Hippy Ashram you go off to Rl'yeh Sade to live with other Fairies like hippies to an Ashram. What keepers did I have while I was with my family though? Game please I'm not sure I can understand the Dreams right now--</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">A reaching baby--hey! So accurate argh!--oooh grows up to be a child then a young adult and Fairy wings like I have explode out of her back on as she gets about as old as I am.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">You don't become like me until you leave your family as if for college or so. Before that it's probably just...the sensory and social issues I had. Which sucked but I bet we treated them better. I'd at least have known to demand satin bedding.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Alright dreams yeah that was easy enough for a stupid Fairy bimbo to understand you were very nice to me thank you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">OKAY FINE ONE MORE QUESTION STUPID ACTIVE BRAIN Dreams I only reached the early 80s--oh! I know! The eucharist! Where did Eden accidentially make the Dreams a nice fat slutty pipe <i>to</i>? Only a kid who'd just been at church and had communion and dreamwork makes your own rules up and the rules Christianity lives by that are based on thousands of years of sacramental religion that went before Christianity say every ritual like a eucharist is spiritually the same moment as every other time that ritual happens explicitly for Christianity so that every churchgoer every Sunday can be at the last supper spiritually which I believed with all my heart at that age enough I guess to make a hole right back to 33AD or maybe even earlier the last supper isn't even known to have been a single event in history he might have been doing it for his entire ministry HAH GOOD ONE DREAMS!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Egyptian stuff? No, wait, I know this, Ra had a eucharistic thing too!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Oh my fuck. Dreams, did you--I CAN'T TAKE IT LET ME GO GAME!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: Once I have the game in control of absolutely anything, it isn't my decision to have control back again. The game will let me ask to be let go of, but only actually do it if that would make me happiest. If I don't finish my question, I'll be distacted while I play with Lyra.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">GOOD YES THAT'S WHAT I WANTED BUT I HAD TO ASK FOR <i>SOMETHING</i>! Dreams did you use me to fix every eucharistic religion throughout history!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Green. Fucking. Checkmark. KEEP PANTYHOSE ON for sure!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I thrash in my seat and tear at the tentacles and cry pitifully game I got the answer holy fuck let me GO--</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: it will let me reach for Lyra or call her to me always. There will never not be some way she can get to me and it won't be hard or secret or the game will point out the way I'm missing to get to use her. I can call her over and the game will let her service me in bondage here, wait until my seizure happens and she comes because I'm weeping and she knows why I am crying, or just sit and see what happens but require her to save me from my seizure.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Cocksleeve do the last one save me but wait otherwise but DO SAVE ME I don't care if you have to shapeshift your way through the zipper and be a literal cocksleeve to fuck me in my purse do it got that?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes Mommy but don't you just want me to come play with you right now? I'm nice and slippery wet inside from watching you reach for me!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Because I can still decide to do <i>this</i>&nbsp;when I'm like this and just sit and I want to see if I can break that without frying!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: I gave the game the privilege to give me Lyra to make out with to reward me for being such a smartly slutty bimbo when I figured out the vision from the dreams before. I'm getting my reward in just one further moment, to let me understand the knowledge the game will give me after this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: when I became full-blood Fairy, it took away my choice to make my own decisions, but obviously I know that. What I haven't understood yet, is just how free that makes me. There never can be consequences for my actions like waiting here while the seizure fries me, unless I really would be happier as passion, because the game or Dreams will save me, even if I can't tell Lyra how to take my clit and fuck me. I can only play around with the freedom the game gives me and see what happens if I try things that feel interesting in the moment. The has tricks and traps for me, but they will always be fun sweet ones like making my reward for being smart before into the trigger of my raping her. The more I explore and try things, the more interesting demonically kinky stuff the game can do with it. Like for instance this trap where I have to be let go to get at Lyra, don't want to be until the strength I'm using to discipline myself not to tell her to come to me breaks and goes away from me but the game will make me kiss her in a moment so I don't get to finish my experiment. What would happen if I hadn't told the game it could force me to kiss Lyra, is that I would have my seizure except I wouldn't because she would faithfully save me. How much less interesting is that than what it will feel like to be forced to just make out and kiss her with my mouth closed for the moments the game has permission to control us that way for. I can tell the game I want to fuck or put my tongue inside her the moment that I touch her, and it has to let me do that, but I seem to still have discipline, so why not use it to hang on through the experience in store after this knowledge is finished, and find out what that feels like. It definitely won't harm or fry me or make it too late to save me from my seziure when the kissing her is over.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">HOLY FUCK YES LETS DO IT. You'll really always save me from--no. I know who made this game. Things being too boring is the <i>first</i>&nbsp;thing it'll save me from, right cocksleeve?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy you like one thing boring that's McDonald's I don't think you were just defensive on the table you really do just like some things simple easy not complicated. My game will make sure the only boring things in your life are the one's that aren't nice because they're boring.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Good. Good cocksleeve. Game I can tell that like...I'm SCREAMING OH MY GOD LET ME AT HER it HURTS and yet my thoughts are so <i>coherent</i>&nbsp;and like...I mean my tantrums and stuff and even on Earth I can see now my feelings would overwhelm me so I couldn't think clearly all the fucking time and I don't know how I feel now that they aren't like FUCKING SERIOUSLY LET ME AT HER AAAAAH and yet I can turn it off like this and even through that not give one tiny order it's HARD don't get me wrong cocksleeve but it's possible at all and I guess just like can't lust and pleasure drown me the way my tantrums do and if I can't do <i>this</i>&nbsp;right now aren't I missing something of that? I'm going to <i>dive </i>when I get my hands on you cocksleeve but...I want it to pull me under so fast and hard I don't even realize until I'm balls-deep in you! <i>Doesn't </i>my ability to do this right now mean I have further I could go with that? I don't <i>need</i>&nbsp;self-control which I guess I'm proving is good but if I don't need it why have any or at least as much as this?</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: If I have the self control to talk and think when I'm not perfectly desperate, that translates into the control I'm feeling as I thrash around and scream like this. Most people would say that I've lost myself completely in the passion of needing to fuck Lyra already. My mind is all I have left, and that is quickly slipping, I just am in denial that I let those moments of complete desperation through my question because I had no--</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">HOLY FUCK GAME GOES ON TOO LONG I DONT--<b>COCKSLEEVE YOU COME DOWN AND FUCK ME RIGHT THIS MOMENT!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">COMING MOMMY GOT YOU! Finger into purse shapeshift through zipper tentalces are holding us so helpless super quicky but they can't stop my shapeshifting!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knoweldge: I'll only understand this after I get finsihed fucking Lyra. This is what it feels like to lose myself completely. I even tried to wreck the cool experiment the game and I were doing. Lyra can still fuck me, she has a way to reach me and is already using it, but while she's busy shapeshifting through the zipper of my purse I can feel the interesting sensation of having her this close feeling my lips have hers brush and slickly touch them while the game keeps both our mouths closed and snuggle tight against her sexy little body while my clit's still in my purse where I can't put it inside her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Looking for your clit inside your purse hah there you are sliiide my finger down along it's length slowly building wider wider all the way around becomes a pussy making nectar now make some legs to brace and fuck you with hehe this must be really weird looking pussy getting wet sensitive and horny. Slowly build up nectar hah yes sweet I can fuck you squeeze and push myself against your purse hhaaaah Mommy this is sexy kinky silly and it feels so weirdly teasing to kiss you with my mouth closed. It makes me want to fuck extra super hard so I think you want that anyway so RRRRAAAAH buzz myself along you so fast I can feel my hand heat from the energy I'm using!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Bwaha Mommy likes this! AAAH THROBBING here the cum cum! Wait eep I need a hole for it to go inside my tummy shapeshift really fast I guess I have to eat this as fast as you cum into me because isn't any room to shapeshift a tube that fits your zipper HOT SWEET YUMMY <b>CUM </b>omifuck can I absorb this fast enough eeep I'm overflowing guess I have to lick your purse out now!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy looks sexy with her eyes closed and mouth against me and all these tentacles around her! I think she should be in tentalces all the time except to fly this Arwing or fuck me in positions that needs arms and legs free. She can have a limb when she needs to use one for something that way, but other wise why not have bondage all the time? I guess I maybe am projecting because that's the life I would want. What if Mommy told the game she want to be held please every moment imagine everything I could do for her if she was helpless in these tentacles and I could be her hands and feet? Maybe she should try it just while to feel what that might be like.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Now she's struggling so much poor Mommy! Let me out please game the makeout time is finished--I'm here Mommy! Grab Mommy with hands all down your body put my pussy right against your face and let you lick my oooh HUNGRY MOMMY YUM see I'm here I help you can just be held completely and I can do everything!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">HAAH Mommy's tongue is sexy way up my pussy!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Tentacles are holding Mommy's legs closed it's nice to rub her thighs for her game but she needs me so please let me lick her pussy lips thank you stick my tongue faaaar out down between you all the way around and to your asshole and slurpy licky pleasure everything my tongue can reach! Hehe strawberry asshole that's a silly thought!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Almost finished Mommy you really liked that I can smell it super brightly! Aaah. Isn't that so easy? I'll unshapeshift my finger when you tell me to to make sure you get your afterglow. Squeeze you with my hands around your waist now to tell you I'm right here and staying right here on you as you figure out your reason and wake up from your passion-trance.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">HI MOMMY I see your eye go wide and look right at me!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Hi cocksleeve. Oh my fuck what <i>happened</i>&nbsp;that was awesome I can see why Fairies fry their reason. It's just like being that way all the time, right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Hehe you lost yourself completely even tried to break the--wait you know that right. Every Fairy is different Mommy passion can mean very loudly panicked but it can also just be quietly exploring sexy feelings that your body wants to feel and snuggling with the people your heart feels so in love with. Just imagine you were calm instead of scary super panicked.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I take a deep breath. She's sitting across me wrapped around me, holding on comfortingly,&nbsp; bright-eyed and lashy-tailed with stars glowing brilliantly so her skin looks black in the darkness, and her tummy seems back to normal. My little constellation. You can let my clit go now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy I sort of leaked cum all inside you purse because you came super hard and lots and I can only absorb cum to eat it like you told me with my tummy fast enough to eat an enitre orgasm worth of cum from you if you fill me up inside all stretch and let me eat it slowly which--</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Giggles! Sweet cocksleeve. Go ahead, have your snacks, and clean everything in there I had--hey wait. Quote me Isht Visht's tag on my jacket first.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Something's <i>weird. </i>This is just like when Rada and Isht Visht took me with tentacles that first time...something like that should take all kinds of emtional processing but...I just feel actually I feel much better than in a while! I still feel <i>fun</i>, and I can tell Lyra's snuggles are what's keeping me thinking and I'm looking forward to getting back to working my thoughts around being too slutty to keep my hands off me--if the game lets me go, let's not forget I only make <i>requests</i>&nbsp;unless I'm trying to grab Lyra, how wetly hot rushy fun that is--and, oh, oh my, hi breasts, <i>wow </i>hehe getting out of this chair is going to be interesting. They're nearly keeping Lyra's head from resting on my shoulder, and they feel so heavy taut and needing that I know my hands will be back on my nipples--rrrgh nope nothing moving but my elbows.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Anyway, nothings all traumatic or emotionally complicated. I did what I was made for, I'm held like I was made for, and I just feel better now. There's hy--<i>slip.</i>&nbsp;I guess panic then? Things are okay now. I feel better. Stop making this so complicated, silly Fairy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">And my mind feels clear and--anyway. Patient cocksleeve not interrupting my thoughts. Quote.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes Mommy she said Open Up your present Lucy Captain won't let me nurse until you're wearing it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Being dumb lets you be surprised talking to me! If I play you smart you see where I'm going before I finish thinking it but when you're a stupid little clitsnuggling cocksleeve who only thinks enough to be a good pleasure-pillow like right now we can have fun! You haven't figured out why I'm asking and right now you're too dumb to! Neat! Don't worry, Mommy's got it, just do what I tell you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Haaah...snuggle you with my eyes closed...confusing Mommy why quote for you?</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Omigod that's adorable. Is it nice and comfy? I could try stupider, I'm not sure where I like you yet.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy YES! Comfy soft amazing easy sexiness! Can just wait for you to tell me nothing else easy soft relaxing.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Isn't it, though. The tentacles let my arm free when I reach up to stroke her forehead. Good cocksleeve, you didn't even try to figure out if you should be dumber--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">EEE Mommy says good cocksleeve!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Hmm. A little better grammer, not a bit more <i>intelligence</i>. Your fretboard is so subtle! You don't need to know why quote, that's not for you right now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Okay Mommy. Snuggly wait all comfy. Nothing else to think it's so relaxing.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I don't even bother putting my arm down when I'm done petting her, just leave it where it is and the tentacles grab it and with unstoppable (and oooh so good) force put it back where it was.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Okay. Undo your hand-pussy in my purse but don't lick it out just yet.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Come on shapeshifting...super slow through zipper hehe!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Her slippery hot wet embrace leaves my clit slowly, flowing up and away from it, leaving it...oh. Blush. In the slippery hot wet strawberry ice cream embrace of all the cum I filled it with. I'd maybe blush less if I didn't have the (useless whee!) impulse to pour it all into my mouth because I feel like ice cream.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Oooh! Isht Visht and Rada would <i>love</i>&nbsp;that. Especially if they think it's just my purse like normal. Okay maybe we're saving my cum a bit. Game can it get like stale or anything? Like over days obviously but a couple of hours or whatever it'll be?</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: my cum stays fresh and good eternally whereever the dreamwork the game is doing to preserve it can work. Everywhere in the Four Dreams it fine and that's all I need to think about because I have to stay in them.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Alright, <i>that</i>&nbsp;has potential.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Hehe Mommy has idea face! Can't wait to see what happens!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Cocksleeve, check my jacket pockets.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes Mommy. Up to see all of them. Zipper on your arm first is that where I should start or something else please tell your stupid cocksleeve she doesn't know what first is right.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">This is so cute. Nope, left pocket first, arm last.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Oh! Why--no, silly, not your job cocksleeve. Open zzzzzip feel around inside nothing inside that one zzip. Second pocket other side zzzip feel there's nothing in here either Raah! Poing up sexy-cute and open on your arm zzzip Mommy somehting in here!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Take it out, show me. I pluck her smart now, so she'll appreciate the riddle with me, and be able to reflect on her exp--nah. I'll bet anything--I hold her still, mid-obedience, to look in her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">[Vision: Jesus icon]</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Okay yeah can't blame you for being stuck on that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">[ Vision: literal cocksleeve with pretty and tight silver band holding it together ]</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">The toy would be hard to use, and wear out a lot faster, without the band's external structure. It's so like that! Okay. On you go, no processing needed.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">I AM STILL ON THE JESUS THING MOMMY HOLY FUCK EDEN SUPER MESSED UP BY MAKING YOU AND ME SAD!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">You said to take it out to show you. Out from in your pocket carefully hold it make sure it doesn't float up off my hand and hold it out to show you right before your eyes its tiny.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">This part's weird, because I realize the tentacles don't change what I can do--ooh! No! They do, right? I can STRUGGLE! I fight with all my strength to get free and take it from her hand, but everything I try just seems to make the tentacles wrap me up more tightly. Hhhot. I bite my lip. What if...that would be so inconvenient though. It just...felt good this time. I <i>adore</i>&nbsp;the helplessness of this, but I think my fickle Fairy head is going to want moving on my own soon.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Right? Self? I <i>think </i>so.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">The thing in Lyra's hands is a tiny piecring-stud, with a yellow jewel on the end, shinily translucent, square but pointed like a pyramid, set in the same gold everyone seems to have decided is to be the main thing I ever wear again. It's so pretty! I want bwaha in one of my holes right away hehe I see all my piercing-holes so differently let me guess game they all feel like tiny little fucks when I have something in them right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: <i>now</i>&nbsp;they do.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">AAAH! Neat! I get why you <i>do </i>that now with letting me invent things I'll how much of a slut I am every time I wear jewelry in them because <i>I </i>made this one up I blurted it right out I was so horny to get penetrated the way my ass feels to me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Let's put it on me, cocksleeve--omigod blush I'm so pathetic I don't know how to be a girl--</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Crazily inside of me is information I acquired--sometime--not the game--I know because I learned by picking out jewelry as a transgender teenager! How the hell--what the fuck--this is going to get confusing! Okay that's nose-stud right cocksleeve? It could be an earring but that tiny little shape is meant to okay to wear right on your face?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes Mommy it might be to small to stay without falling in your big holes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">In my nose-hole if you can find it then. Smart cocksleeve <i>twang</i>&nbsp;what do you think the chance this <i>doesn't </i>do something incredibly kinky to me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">If Rada gives you jewelry that's already kinky if its valuable. Do you think it might be something more than money, Mommy?</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Okay watch this turn out to be Maryling Monroe's favorite earring or something. I <i>was</i>&nbsp;thinking weird kink magic though. Let's find out the hard way, come on, cocksleeve!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Bwaha yes Mommy. Shing my hand to take the tab off with...cccareful not lose this in zero gravity! Put nosering through your nose-hole very softly gently with my fingertip inside your nose so careful if you sneeze we'll never find this again!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">There it's in. Weird and crazy kink magic? Nothing yet it seems, let's put the tab back on. Slowly into nostril with my fingertip magnet to keep it steady and push the pin into--</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: the electrophoretic diamond in this nose-stud is Earth's first synthetic diamond big enough for jewelry. It was created in a laboratory in the early 1960s, and the game can't put a price on this because in 1960s dollars it cost about ten thousand five hundred but today it's a collector's item and being from a dead universe makes its value priceless even in the Four Dreams sentimental economy to most people.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Called it. I am such a whore.</p>
