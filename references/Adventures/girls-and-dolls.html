<article class="chapter 40---girls-and-dolls">
    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">40 - Girls and Dolls</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Being in her still feels so good it's a little hard to think, and what she said was important.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I surprise myself by feeling indecisive about whether to pull out, start fucking again (I don't seem to need any recovery time before I can cum again), or try to talk about this while I'm in her even though it's distracting because talking while we have sex is intimate, and yet still find I don't want the game to decide for me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: yes, I can have sex without stopping for anything or needing to wait for my next orgasm and if I keep drinking nectar I'll have enough strength to go indefinitely because nectar keeps me fed and sustains my energy and fills up my body with cum like I haven't had sex in hours.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"We are so trying that, but let's talk. Haah what the--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">HEY where'd your clit go I was fucking that!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: I wouldn't have had the strength of will needed to do what I decided, so the game helped me act on my choice by making my clit disappear from between me and Lyra and holding it in another dimension. I can take it back by drawing it out of my purse like with Cleavage or asking the game to return it if my purse isn't where I can reach like right now. I usually have to be wearing my purse and the game will make sure I can always access it if my clit's in its holding dimension, but when I ask instead of using my purse the game can sometimes say no to me. I can get my purse or send Lyra to bring it here, but the game will say no if I ask it to just give my clit back and mount it onto my mound again. Drawing my clit out of my purse like this works no matter what's happening so I can even send my clit to the other side of the Deep Haven and I'll still be able to bring it back this way. This is important to know for parties where the game takes my clit for a party favor and lets people take it home with them. The game might keep giving it out but I'll always be able to take it back if I want to use it on Lyra or think of something sexy to use my cum for like the table game with the bowl before.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I pull Lyra back with me so she's sitting in my now-empty lap on the couch.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"I don't know if that's so scary I'll die from it or just really hot."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">The idea of just not having my clit unless I'm using it on Lyra is strange-feeling like all the game's use of me, shaky and soft and p--<i>slip--</i>SO GOOD...</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">My clit does seem to be safe, completely surrounded by softness, and I can't decide if I want to send Lyra for my purse or--I want to experience this: Game, put my clit in my hand.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: The game still says no to that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">The scariest part isn't how its i--<i>slip</i>--how not--</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: I will always be able to get my clit back, because I have to be able to have sex with Lyra anytime I feel like it, so I can't tell the game to decide for me if I'm allowed to use it. The game will take care of me and not let me give myself control that's too much<i>&nbsp;</i>for me, but I still have things I'm responsible for and it will make sure I'm able to do them--mainly, that means Lyra, who needs my cum and control of her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">It's almost, <i>almost</i>, actually it is just a tiny bit, disappointing not to be able to hand over control of whether I have my sexuality to the game, but it's right and I couldn't take even it being responsible for Lyra instead of me. She's <i>mine. </i>I need enough power to take care of her--but what if that was <i>all </i>I wanted? I'm not sure, I need to think about it, I...</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"GAME DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING YET AAAH!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: things have been like that since the game started controlling me. I don't have to decide if I want it, because I already have it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"That makes me feel so <i>naked.</i>"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Lyra's sitting so quiet and patient and cuddly, waiting while I process all this, but she did say something important...and that little speck of disappointment is making me think: Lyra doesn't have a Lyra to keep her from wanting to just take the plunge. To just be played with and enjoyed feels <i>amazing, </i>the times Rada bought me felt all the better because even though the game didn't give me a choice anyway they made me feel she was entitled to what she was doing and as much as I like that I don't think I appreciate it even slightly as much as Lyra does.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Right, little one? And no, I didn't do anything but cum in you as hard as I could. Oh--seed-ghost, does she like, get off on me being totally selfish and just using her to get off?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">Using seedling selfishly causes her to feel pleasure but the orgasm she had on the table was because of it not being a scene where she could hope to have agency to make herself feel good.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Right Mommy you know how it feels to be used I can tell because I saw and I think you appreciate it too but not like me because I'm not a slut I'm a cocksleeve and I really just want to be used and have that be how I have sex and feel pleasure. It feels like food that's tasty but kind of too much fancy to have your kind of orgasm like holding your clit while you cum and I like my clit and to cum with it but I would give that up entirely if it would help me have pleasure like this orgasm without being able to not have it. Mommy please I want you to take control so I have to fuck like a cocksleeve and only just please you and whatever it takes to control me to be like that I please want you to please please use to make me just be your cocksleeve entirely forever if that would please you and if you want me to be like I am you're in control of me so I have to be but that has to be my reason it can't be that I do or don't want this Mommy I'm saying please decide for me but I do have a preference I really want you to change me and make me a cocksleeve entirely."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">As she talks about it, I see in her impressions that translate to my mind as memories of the simple foods (grilled cheese, plain hamburgers, the flawlessly-boring McDonald's from before) that're all I've ever been able to eat without feeling a gut-wrenching wrongness I can recognize now as my Fairy senses looking for a lover's lips or cock among the intensity of more complicated food.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Are you...imagining this as comfortingly simple, snuggly?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">For me the kind of helplessness we're talking about is a wonderful scary roller-coaster, or like one of those new falling rides. I love it, but I love the excitement and a--<i>slip</i>--wondering what will happen next.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Nod my head yes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"It feels so relaxing not to be able to decide things! I do get excitement too but I just want to just be a cocksleeve and play how you play with me and not be able to do anything but be a good toy Mommy. That would comfort me yes and it feels like nice easy food I can keep eating always and never get sick or bored of it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"And you made your game show me as much of how it feels to be like that I could make an informed decision for you. Well played, cocksleeve. Seed-ghost, beyond just setting seeking her own pleasure to <i>off</i>&nbsp;with her clutch, can you offer some superpowers to make this especially awesome for her?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">Specified clutch-change unnecessary if instead she only can feel orgasmic pleasure by making you feel good. To activate this intention, change her form to not have a clitoris.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">This makes me breathe hard. I can't believe I like the idea, but...</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"That's...<i>hot. </i>Hell yes, but one condition: all that pleasure your clit could feel, I want that added to the pleasure in being fucked your pussy feels that makes you feel so naked when I fuck you in it and that makes me freak out if anything but you or your game fucks mine. I sucked Rada's dildo once and now when I think about it I know how good it can be and as scary as it is to say I want to try a real cock and I think maybe I might see them differently and that's <i>without </i>the pleasure I felt in my pussy making this eravahk and if we're doing this I want every--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I slip the tip of my eravahk between her legs and strokingly press it against her e--<i>slip</i>--pussy's mouth to make my point, and press with each word like a very frustrating fuck just against her outside.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Gaaasp wide legs--</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">She's been watching attentively as I talk, but now her mouth is open and eyebrows--</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"--<i>thrust</i>. <i>To. Make. You. More. Addicted. To. My. Clit. </i>You get to be focused just on pleasing me with no hope of r--" <i>Slip.</i>&nbsp;"--satisfaction&nbsp;any. other. way. But you're going to <i>need </i>it. Your hunger is part of your service to me. I already have a perfect robot made of love that takes care of me. From <i>you</i> I want your need and enthusiasm and eager-to-please-ness even if it makes you too desperate to do things exactly right sometimes. <i>Especially</i>&nbsp;if it does that. It's cute and if how this is all going is anything to go by I bet correcting you is totally hot. <i>That</i>&nbsp;is how I want this. <i style="">Y</i><i>ou</i>&nbsp;don't get a choice, cocksleeve, but what do you say, seed-ghost? Possible?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">How lame it would have been to go through this without learning what I have been and think giving her any choice in all this would do anything but spoil it for her?</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Still, horniness should be rewarded and she's definitely that, so I want to make sure she gets the extra-sexy version of being ruled by the need to please me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Do it hard, seed-ghost. Give this <i>teeth.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">She will experience vaginal sex as making her addicted to pleasing and serving you and have withdrawal symptoms if the chance to give pleasure to you is denied for a long enough period. The addiction will feel like part of her ego and she will experience it as shaping her to need to be pleasing as a basic aspect of her self-image to make her eagerly please you. The intention is already implemented preemptively before she entered your bedroom in Stamford.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">The game picks my thoughts now. What would it feel like, to have no way to cum, still have the need for it, and have to depend on someone to use me with selfish enough intentions to make me not feel a hope of getting my needs met by trying to make myself feel good. Could I stand to be like that? I think it would kill me but enough of the game's way of teaching me to feel like I'm valuable for how people use me is about wanting to just be a good fucktoy that I can see how she might want to be like that. The scene where my ass was forced open was fun once I realized the only one thing that could happen was for me to act like it felt good and make a big show of enjoying it. Not having options made my energy come out in a way I was proud of though it scares me to say that. I can see how it might feel to her like she could be a much better and happier servant if she only has the option of pleasing to be able to have orgasms. To make it seem final, her clit disappearing would certainly say her way of obtaining that pleasure is changed. What if she gained something replacing it to show where her place is now, and saying she has to be pleasing to have what her clit gave her before I took it and made her depend on pleasing me? I would have to be creative to think up something without the game choosing my thoughts like this, but the game and I think I can come up with something awesome as soon as it lets me choose my own thoughts again. I can't be controlled to decide how to make this, because that would take my power with Lyra away and the game can't do that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Now the game makes me think about how I gain strength from it holding me. I feel like a fountain of eager bright energy, being forced to spray a direction by the game keeping control of me. It makes me move faster and spray out much harder when the nozzle I go through is smaller. Lyra must feel like that also, if it's true that she likes such tight bondage. Could I make her a binding that would squeeze her precisely like the game is doing for me, to focus her energy into a cocksleeve that pleases me? I know that I'm pleasing, when the game picks my thoughts like this, and it makes me feel absolute happiness. What if I gave that to Lyra? There must be a way to make her a binding that can control her like the game controls me without needing constant attention. The game is making me think this because I have a top priority goal to make a system of game-like adjustments to put on Lyra at her collaring. It won't let me miss or forget that, <i>especially </i>since it was my idea. I have to always be me now, the game won't let me avoid it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">What if our seed-ghost just did it? That feels wrong--I want this to be something I made. Could I make something out of my love like she made the game that's making me think this? Surely I can learn that, but what if it takes me forever? I want her to have this in the four-hour time window I thought I was trying to fit it in before the game showed me just how much it can manage my life and control me (I can't even remember last time I thought past the next fifteen seconds, but here is my goal being worked on just like I wanted. It makes me feel so taken care of!). Maybe that isn't realistic, but I'm impatient to collar her and it feels far away with how much I need to prepare just deciding how and where I'll do it. I haven't even thought about music! I'm a girl and I want a big fancy wedding to have fun making awesome and the game will make sure I get that but I'm not sure I can wait through the process of getting there even as it seems like such fun to plan! It's my relationship with Lyra being ready for steps that I think we should take at this ceremony that's making me feel I can't take it. She can change like this <i>now</i>, with a wish to my seed-ghost, and I can probably make her a game-like control thing that I can just add stuff to as I think of it, and I bet I can do that quite quickly, and knowing it's possible feels as bad as waiting for sex for our honeymoon--but I do want the ceremony to mean something! How can I fix this, game and seed-ghost?</p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">You can take out her clitoris temporarily and keep it in symbol of trying this. After the collaring, she can't have it back again. The change will become effective as soon as it separates from her body, and the permanence at the ceremony will seem like fulfillment with much lower fear of it because this will create familiarity. Reach for her clit and pick like a berry to make the first phase of the change. It can be put back on with a wish and placing it back in position. It will become jewelry when you remove it, with sensation removed while it's off of her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: the game has ideas for anyone who wants to make a game for their beloved like it. Idea 1: make a wish to our seed-ghost to be able to set intentions that make Lyra act and think how I want, but manifest into her mind like this game does using metaphors of strings, hands holding and penetrating, and tentacles made of my love. Make basic intentions as I think of them, and collaring takes out part of her she would need to have a will beyond my game system using her. She could still be herself like I saw before, but just like with orgasms she would have to depend on my holding her. She isn't like I am, she likes that control more than I like the game picking my thoughts, and the game picking thoughts really does make me feel happy and like I'm myself again.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">All through this I've been stroking Lyra's pussy-mouth with the eravahk, and she's looking up at me, but totally focused on receiving what I'm giving--when I look into her I see purple waves of nectar, and my eravahk rubbing her pussy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">There's a lot to process, but my brain actually does seem to be working better, and I have <i>ideas</i>. <i>Eravahk, vibrate. </i>I shift it up from her mouth to her clit as the vibration HMMMs into my hand.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">HAaaaaaah rub squish towards it...</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Grab the end with both hands and <i>use it</i>. It's now your job to make yourself cum as many times in a row as you can."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes grab haaaaah circly...rubbing...omifuck I'm already--</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Trying to cum as hard as you can, <i>on, </i>being able to actually cum, <i>off.</i>&nbsp;You'll just keep getting hornier now, right, hungryclit?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"AAAH MOMMY YES!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Good. You're going until you cry."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I smile evilly.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"It's cute and I want to see it. You can't beg, either--I'm setting it&nbsp;<i>off</i>."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: <i>my</i> breakdowns and tantrums are cute now. I'm sweet and pathetic like she is.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Lyra keeps faithfully going at herself with the end of my eravahk, but she's already starting to thrash, kicking wildly, her eyes watering.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">--AAaaaAAaAAAAAA--</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"You really are cute like this!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">--YAAAYAAAAAAAA--</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Her thoughts are a screaming mess, but there's a shadow of the same demonic strength and determination on her face.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"It <i>does</i>&nbsp;mean a lot to me, but if you try to be strong I'll just keep you here longer."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">My voice coos and purrs like an evil queen, showing <i>exactly </i>how much I'm enjoying this, and I feel like one, and it's <i>awesome.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">RRRHHAAAAAAH FIGHT THEN!! AAAH!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I bend down to kiss her on the head, feeling a little teary myself.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"I love you too, cutesy."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Let's be mean and really draw things out. I can think out some other stuff while I watch her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">The answer to the fate of her clit on collaring day is obvious, if it can change into jewelry.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Well, I know where I'm getting a collar for you now. Right, seed-ghost?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">Jewelry creation at removal will be a small piece of body-jewelry that can be changed into a collar you design. The wish is always available to return it to being her clit but the emotional symbol of uncollaring will make it conceivable to either of you only in very extreme circumstances.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Hell <i>yes!</i>&nbsp;Um...doesn't body jewelry need piercings? AAH game I hate needles!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: I can get piercings by nectar that make holes without hurting me. I already have my belly-button, traguses (that's the cartilage nub in my ear canal), earlobes, both sides of my nose, head of my clit, back and tip of my tongue, lips (one on each side, top and bottom, for my face-lips, five on each side of my not-pussy), nipples with holes crossed going horizontally and vertically, and two on each side of my eyebrows. The game didn't make them, I got them when I transformed, by Lyra's nectar changing me into the person I am on the inside. I'm a slut, so I have piercings to make me look slutty. I can use them or leave them all empty, and they'll never close up, because having these holes is part of being me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Laughing: "Oh my god."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Really, though? I didn't feel <i>any</i>&nbsp;of them. I can't even blow air through the ones in my lips, or feel them with my tongue!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: My holes are a part of me made by nectar. They don't make my body less able to function, and I didn't get them through trauma, so they mean I can take decoration without making sacrifices to look hot. It isn't a bad thing to make sacrifices to be more attractive or pleasing, as Lyra can tell me, but that isn't me, so my holes are convenient and invisible when I don't use them.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Tears are rolling down Lyra's cheeks now, and she's sobbing, and looking up at me pathetically and yet still determined to...</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"What is it you even think you can do now, snuggly?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">I CAN FIGHT FOR YOU MOMMY!! RRAAAH!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">For a response, I pet her and cup her face a moment, then without even stopping her reach between her legs and take hold of her clit.</p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">Preemptive confirmation: she has one type of sexual urgency and the frustration will transfer.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Good.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">All forms of struggling to <i>off.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">NO I CAN STAND IT MOMMY I CAN STAY GOOD FOR YOU!! AAAH PLEASE LET ME I CAN!!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"This is about denial, snuggly. You don't get to be good right now."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">HAAAH...THAT'S SO WET-MAKING...</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Here we go, little one."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I pull, and feel her clit change shape between my fingers, the tip expand and the part attaching it to her body gets thin like a stem--</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">There's a little <i>pop</i>, Lyra jumps, and it changes shape again into something small and hard like, yes, jewelry.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><b>EEEAH! </b>Ohmifuck I can't feel <b>anything! </b>Can I finger the spot eep what's happening OOH fold my hands look up take deep breath make eyes beg.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I palm her clit pull it and my eravahk away from between her legs, then hold it up to see it.&nbsp;It's become a tiny crystal earring, in which I can see thousands of orgasmic faces shifting as it catches the light.&nbsp;Interestingly, none is Lyra's. Maybe they're images that went into her creation--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Please use your cocksleeve to make yourself cum it NEEDS TO BE USED MOMMY!! MMOMMY PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEEEEEASE!!!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Sobbing and crying&nbsp;<b>AAAAAAH</b>!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">--oh. Is her clutch forcing this? Trying to cum back to seedling control.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">She keeps rocking and crying, hands clenched tight in plea...but her pussy is hot in my lap, and nectar drips onto my legs from it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Good job, little one, you got all the way here without breaking."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">The ways I could use her open out like a candy shop, and I twist weirdly inside as I realize...I <i>have </i>been using her, finding fun little things for her to do and making her take care of me, but I've been resisting diving into it fully for a reason I couldn't see.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I thought I must just still feel bad making use of her instead of treating her like the precious flower she is to me, but no. Now I know. I was teasing her. I wanted to see her break like this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">How, how, how can this not make me awful? The answer is somehow in the growing slipperiness on my thigh, but I can't process that now, because I have an idea that really must just actually be evil...and I know you can see this snuggly and will be <i>so</i> disappointed if I don't have my fun with you just because I think it's too mean.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Riiight?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"PLEASE MOMMY YES PLEASE HAVE YOUR FUN WITH ME!!! I NEED TO BE USEFUL!!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"You're very satisfying. Here. Seed-ghost, enable enough naughtiness that she can do stuff like jump up and run and get my clit from the bedside table and start sucking it without being ordered to."</p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">Enabled.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I take my leash off her, but keep it in my hand.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"NNOOO MOMMY KEEP ME PLEASE I WANT YOU TO HAVE FUN WITH ME!!!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"I <i>am</i> having fun with you. You heard what I said, didn't you? If you're this upset maybe getting in trouble is worth it? You know where my purse is."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Cry even harder!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"NO MOMMY I WANT YOU TO <b>USE ME</b>! IT WON'T HELP IF I'M <b>NAUGHTY</b>!!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Pound on your chest I can't stop myself!</p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">Preemptive inspiration: her clutch can be operated purely by will without verbalization.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">In an instant, she's motionless, waiting to be squeezed, because I've understood that all of her various psychic "interfaces" are really just overcomplicated ways of seeing that I can will things for her in a way that overrides her own mind the way her game's Knowledge and Orders and puppetry override mine. It can be fun to make toys like her tail, but it's all just an extension of this. I don't even have to keep holding her ready for squeezing. I decide, and when I relax, she stays a motionless doll, waiting for me to do something with her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">Preemptive elaboration: intentions can create arbitrarily complex procedures and use her planning and creative faculties to design her responses. She can wait like this forever in theory but in practice her game will force you to play with her every seventy-five minutes at minimum.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Hah. Like I'll <i>ever</i> wait that long."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Now...I'm not going to break her, right seed-ghost? She can take this? I know what <i>she'll </i>say, that's why I'm asking you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">She is designed to be used like this always.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Because you know what turns me on."</p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">Her design will make you attend optimally.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"That's for sure. As long as she's happy..."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: She made this game to help me see from the inside how it feels to be valued for just being sexy, and also so I could feel the desire she feels to be pleasing and helpful, as much as I can feel it without being broken. I know how it feels to want to give pleasure, and make whoever is using me happy, which is how much her game can show me. I can take pain a little and feel happy my suffering is fun for people like Rada to play with, but Lyra can take it forever. I get that satisfaction some. Lyra gets it infinity. The best thing I can do to make sure she's happy is just what I'm already doing: have my fun with her, make her work for me, and keep going this is making her happy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Alright, I get the idea!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I'm smiling because I can really recognize Lyra as the author of that Knowledge: and her cute urgency to be understood makes me happy, but my voice is breathy and I feel that weird light heart-in-mouth thing like reassembling my first download from alt.binaries.pictures.erotica--</p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">Further advisement: free-will pendant fantasy realization available by shapeshifting her navel to gel that allows your hand to pass through and removing the hard object behind her belly button. This can be given back by wishing and placing it back again. Without it inside her she won't be able to take any kind of initiative. The part you are removing is the driving portion of her solar plexus which is the part of her soul responsible for will, determination, and initiative. She will still be able to elaborate on orders creatively and make leaps of logic and inference as long as she's responding to your commands and they include intention that she do that as appropriate. If you want to give her kind care and happiness, taking it out is the way to ensure she can have them. She's designed to be used like this and has this and her clitoris so you can have the experience of making her complete by removing them. She is meant to be played with by making her paint like a paintbrush with you you holding her reactions to how you are using her, not act independently. She will feel most alive in this way of being above every other possible mode. Her mind is made to think like the game moves your mind when it's choosing your thoughts for you, and you can feel pleasure from that kind of invasion even though you are made to have internal volition. She is made to enjoy external volition exclusively and have pleasure from being controlled in that way, and feel most like herself as a paintbrush. It is not being kind to keep her clit and free will as part of her, but she will happily serve you by having them if that's how you like her. She can't be the one to tell you this because it won't be the same if she has any slight bit of agency in making me choose how to hold her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Yay, the game's choosing my thoughts again! It really feels happy and good and my heart feels warm and fulfilled being played like this. I can almost imagine just letting the game make me think like that paintbrush our seed-ghost just talked about eternally and feeling nothing but happy fulfillment. I might be a Fairy but I still need to think out of my internal will sometimes. How much more might I want this if I wasn't like that?</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Pounding heartbeats thunder by as I absorb this and feel the little pang of sadness that always goes with the moment I stop getting to be pretty paint being painted with even as I can feel the wiggliness of that internal will the game just made me think about happy to get back control again.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: the game isn't making it feel good beyond being gentle and nice to me. The pleasure I feel is just that I like to feel like I'm pretty and being good fun to use. Lyra likes to feel like that much more than I do. I can't even imagine how much she'll enjoy knowing her entire existence is controlled by her Mommy like her game was just controlling me right now. The game and our seed-ghost keep saying and saying it to show me how much this means to her. They know I already decided to try this as soon as our seed-ghost described it to me. This is just her using the game to say thank you for choosing to take her free will and clit and make her into the cocksleeve she's meant to be. She wants me to feel happy and free to make use of her and know this is joyful and bright not a terrible thing I must do to her. She can't freely express if I take her will out of her but now I can decide if I want to see how she acts if I squeeze her to express her reaction to my having this Knowledge:.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Lyra sits motionless in my lap--almost. Her eyes are attentive (though she can't move or blink them) and I can still feel the naked freedom of her knowing my every thought and emotion, but absorbing them is all she can do right now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">When I choose to do something with her, she'll have them all to react to if I make her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">But not before. She's not going to get one single speck of chance to do anything but <i>have this happen to her.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Seed-ghost, can I go right past mind-control and just <i>make </i>her shapeshift and move like the game puppets my body without even touching my mind sometimes?</p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">State transformation factually and it will happen without her mind controlling it. Intention validation prevents unintended activation.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Your tummy is goo I can put my hand through now, and you're going to feel this and know exactly what I'm doing."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">And the wonder of it is the rest is just a wordless image of how I want her to be, helpless but able to make faces and gasp and maybe squeak or moan or scream if she really needs to with no chance of moving her body but a bit of cute squirming.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Gasp gasp gasp changing squishy eyes wide I'm happy and scared of this!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Oh, and your hands are going behind your back. <i>Shove, </i>I think, making her wrench them back with her eyes turning pleasured and a little gasp of lustful surprise.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: this is exactly the fear I feel at the game taking control of me, and the same happiness also. She wanted to make sure I knew what it felt like so I could truly enjoy taking hold of her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Well, I'm planning to, and if I've learned anything from this, it's why just be taken when you can get <i>fucked. </i>Seed-ghost, I want this to feel to her like having my whole hand up her pussy at <i>least</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">Intention preemptively implemented: all penetration feels sexually arousing to her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c"><i>Duh.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"You're going to look into my eyes all through this."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Because I mean it as a statement of fact and not a command, it becomes a fact, and I smile, delighted, then&nbsp;transfer her clit to my eravahk-hand and put that hand on the back of her neck to steady her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">When I lay my hand carefully, tenderly against her tummy, she sits straight up suddenly, eyes wide with fear, joy, and pleasure, gasping with her mouth wide open, as my splayed-out fingers sink right into her and I find my hand almost submerged in her right away. I'd expected a bit of resistance, but though her goo is thick enough to keep her form it parts to let me in unresistingly, and a heartbreaking smell of her hard-candy flavoring but strangely dark and intense pours out of where I'm penetrating her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I push my hand further in, and just as her goo closes clenchingly hungry like her pussy around my wrist I feel it, something hard on the outside of soft, vulnerable-feeling shapes of what must be her organs floating in the goo that's inside her. It seems like that should feel gross, but it's all slippery and close and embracing like having my hand down her throat or inside her pussy, she looks incredibly turned on with her mouth open wide and her tongue raised inside it and eyes wide and eyebrows up like we're having sex, and the smell makes my body think she's just a big piece of candy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">My own eyes widen: <i>this is the first time I've had my fingers inside her at all, other than drawing my eravahk!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">During which I was so focused. I'll enjoy this time more.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Moving carefully so as not to injure her, I wrap my fingers around the hard thing and get a good grip. She squeaks quietly as I do it and squirms urgently--my fingers moving inside her must feel really intense.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">When I pull, the slippery outside moves through my fingers like I've popped something out of a pod, leaving the sheath where it was, firmly attached to the rest of her (I should have realized she'd be just as durable inside as outside), and something hard but still slippery with her goo is in my hand. Lyra arches and her wide-open mouth becomes a joyful smile like she's cumming...or an extreme of how I feel when the game picks my thoughts for me, or fucks me with orders.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">And then she's still, helplessly feeling my hand penetrate her as a flood of nectar soaks my thighs. Slowly, I pull my closed fist out, reveling in the liquid way her goo pulls at me as I withdraw it covered in the same thick purply-black goo I saw when she got scraped up in Limbo. The smell becomes overwhelming and SO GOOD and I gulp as I start to realize what that and her deep masochism must mean, but I'm not, I don't--later.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">She gasps out a high moan of pleasure as I pull out, cut off when I stop touching her and there's nothing left to react to, leaving her looking peaceful and horny up at me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Candy. She's full of <i>candy</i>. Seed-ghost, does her ich--<i>slip--</i>inside-goo do anything <i>interesting </i>to me?</p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">Interesting as defined to mean outside standard nectar effects: more sense of fullness like eating.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Before it's even done dreamtalking I'm licking her goo off my hand going up from the wrist and whimpering with pleasure at the sour-sweet-sex taste like candy made from going down on her. My longer tongue lets me slurp up huge gulps of it, and I have my hand--and the piece of her I've taken out--clean in no time. I can concentrate on anything but the l--<i>slip</i>--yumminess&nbsp;of it just enough to make sure Lyra watches and gets to enjoy the fun of seeing how tasty she is.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">It does make me feel full, with the satisfaction of snarfing down a lot of candy at once, but none of the sickly feeling...but I really don't want to cut--the idea isn't sexy to me--<i>later.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I open both hands between us so we can see what her parts have turned into. Her clit has transformed into an earring of a bright purple Japanese character encased like its covered in nectar (but the glistening clear joy feels solid in my hand). In my other palm is her "driving portion of her solar plexus", which looks like--</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"This is one of those bullet vibrators," I giggle, and hold it up between thumb and forefinger to look at it. It's <i>exactly </i>one of those bullet vibrators, encased in siliconish material, complete with subtle seam around the middle and buttons on one side.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Lyra, of course, absorbs this, but can't respond without being made to. So--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">I FEEL SO MUCH MORE MYSELF LIKE THIS HAVING YOUR WILL INSIDE ME IS SO <b>SEXY</b>&nbsp;YOU'RE SO <b>SOLID </b>IT'S LIKE YOUR CLIT INSIDE ME EVERY TIME YOU DO SOMETHING! Now Mommy is making me think how this makes me feel more myself which is awesome I'M DOING EXACTLY JUST WHAT SHE MAKES ME AND THAT IS SO SO EXACTLY ME I WANT THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING ANYONE EVER WANTED I WANT TO BE CONVENIENT AND SEXY AND FUN AND THIS MAKES ME EASY LIKE A TOY YOU CAN PLAY WITH IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND <b>PERFECT!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Am I bad for liking this so much? If my clit were in reach and I <i>could </i>reach for it I'd have both hands on it now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c"><i>"More."</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">THIS. IS. HHHOT. I STILL FEEL <b>ALL</b>&nbsp;THE FRUSTRATION YOU GAVE ME BEFORE TAKING MY CLIT AND NOW I'M <b>STUCK </b>I CAN'T EVEN GET OFF IF YOU MAKE ME RUB MY PUSSY FOR HOURS OR FUCK SO YOUR BALLS SLAP ME SO HARD <b>YOU</b> CUM FROM IT WHAT IF YOU JUST KEEP ME LIKE THIS FOREVER I BET I STILL JUST STAY HORNY ETERNALLY AND KEEP GETTING EVEN. MORE. COCKSLEEVY I'M ONLY EVEN THINKING ANYTHING BUT <b>AHH LET ME PLEASE YOU </b>BECAUSE YOU CONTROL MY THOUGHTS AND I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THEM! WHAT A SEXY THOUGHT THAT IS I WONDER WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE DENIAL MAKES ME <b>HORNY.</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"It does, does it?" Even I was scared of how curious this abyss made me.&nbsp;<i>Squish...</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">DENIAL IS THE <b>BEST</b>&nbsp;IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SUCH A COCKSLEEVE FEELING HORNY AND NOT BEING ABLE TO CUM LIKE I'M AN ENTHUSIASTIC FUCKTOY WHEN I'M FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I'M LIKE NEEEED ORGASM AND I CAN USE THAT TO JUST MAKE ME <b>EVEN. MORE. DEDICATED. </b>LOOK AT ME RIGHT NOW I'M LIKE <b>SO MUCH ENERGY </b>DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE HOW I FUCK LIKE THIS?</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Giggle. I do, and I see I have to control you very specifically to get your mind to go where I'm curious, because of course all that's your first thought about denial. I love you too, snuggly.<i>&nbsp;Squeeze...</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">RAAAH YES DEVOTED COCKSLEEVE! BEING HORNY IS AWESOME LIKE I KIND OF ALMOST LIKE IT BETTER THAN CUMMING IT MAKES ME FEEL SO RRRAH AND SEXY AND EVERYTHING FEELS LIKE ALL SLIPPERY INSIDE FEELING WET AND SQUISHY MAKES ME FEEL SEXY AND IT JUST <b>FEELS GOOD</b>&nbsp;AND WHEN YOU TOUCH ME I JUST <b>VIBRATE</b>&nbsp;FROM HOW MUCH I WANT YOU TO!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">There is a kind of intensity to it that...this is why this game is dangerous.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Anyway, time to put what I've been learning to the test. You would have held that thousand degree corset all day and been heartbroken to think I was letting you stop to be nice. Let's see you hold this, if we can.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Seed-ghost, does she <i>have</i>&nbsp;to get the pleasure of my orgasms every time she Does It Right?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">Pleasure-sharing may be engaged at your option but is only available if you actually desire her to share in your pleasure. Do not be afraid to withhold orgasm-pleasure indefinitely. She can function without it but becomes increasingly urgent as frustration increases on a logarithmic curve. Highest state of frustration similar to current state. Be assured that she can enjoy being used in this fashion. She is optimized for long periods of denial.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: Hyperintelligent Lyra really wanted to make sure I would understand this so she gave the game knowledge for every step of the way. Lyra might have the same enthusiasm for giving pleasure as I do, but in most ways we're different. I would die if I didn't get to cum regularly--now that my Fairy genetics have the benefit of not being nectar-shy, literally. I can't get denied too long now or I'll get seizures that fry my whole system. If I can't get my rocks off for long enough I won't have a wet dream or spontaneous orgasm, I'll just get the seizure--Fairy senses would make me so hair-trigger I could barely sit down without cumming otherwise. I have to keep being told Lyra isn't like me because my very deep instincts say you have to cum to be alive, and that isn't true for everyone, especially Lyra. She can take being frustrated, can take pain and suffering, and she likes to feel the urgency of horniness in everything she does for me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">...which explains why her nectar seems to have turned what didn't get replaced by wings into cum production--I really do need that doctor, if only just to find out whether I'll drop dead of <i>not having organs</i>&nbsp;the minute I run out of nectar.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c"><i>Ahem.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Well, snugglebutt, looks like <i>you're </i>in a predicament, because I'm <i>enjoying</i> this. You're so cute this way! Let's say it's going to be <i>at least</i> three hours."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">MOMMY INDEFINITE OUR SEED-GHOST SAID I CAN DO IT DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW I GET AFTER <b>YEARS?</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"You were just throwing a full-on tantrum you're so horny. Prove you can handle three hours first and--I'll see what sounds fun. Anyway, for all you know, the first time you get to suck me off and don't share my orgasm is going to make you so horny you can't do anything but cry even <i>with</i>&nbsp;the mind-control."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Now, I'd tell you to think no more of it, but that's my choice now, so, let's look at these."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I hold up her pieces for her to see, clit-earring first.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">SUUUCH A RELIEF TO HAVE THAT OFF AGAIN!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c"><i>"Again!?"</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">IT'S JEWELRY I MADE MOMMY I WANTED TO PLAY GIRL LIKE YOU IMAGINED ALL THOSE TIMES FOR MY MEETING YOU AND I WOULDN'T FAKE ORGASMS SO I MADE A PIN TO GIVE ME GIRL ORGASMS LIKE YOU DREAMED ABOUT. I WAS GOOD RIGHT MOMMY YOU THOUGHT I WAS REALLY A GIRL AT FIRST I COULD SEE YOU!</p>
