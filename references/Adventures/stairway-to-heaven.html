<article class="chapter 90---stairway-to-heaven">
    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">90 - Stairway to Heaven</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We're checking the mail, clopping up to the white-with-red-robins mailbox at the end of the driveway with Boobsong in ponyform and swinging her sideways to face it after we pass it from behind&nbsp;because it's fun to make her step fancy for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Proud dance sideways whee!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She's in ponyform and I'm riding and this isn't <i>too </i>unprincessy so I can open the mailbox myself and see what the mail is. Not much today, a catalog stuffed vertically and a letter leaning up against it--will that be--I grab the letter. This is the reason I'm checking the mail today, even though we have Sugarfeast baskets to make.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Strange feelings swirl. Return address on Mass Ave in Cambridge but the big MIT is obvious anyway--there was another letter on the bottom of the mailbox. What are the chances they both came on the same day--don't answer that, Acme Station. I grab the other letter, too, and sure enough: <i>Office of Admissions </i>and the address I recognize as Northeastern University's. I'd just applied to both places when everything happened.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I hold one in each hand, dual-wielding my future...right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess your pony is here with you and she takes your heat happily grraaaaah!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The answer is in Boobsong's sudden determination and the bitter tears that sizzle as they boil off my cheeks when I look down to see the boy's name I remember growing up with repeated twice in front of me like <i>this is who you are going to become, all roads lead to <b>Mister</b> Leo Hardred.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"My <i>name</i>&nbsp;is <i><b>Rainbow.</b></i>"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I file them together and go to tear them in half, then stop, because something so poetic occurs to me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Acme Station, hack the cable up there, get on the internet and find me the source to SpaceWar, and then make these into a punch card of it--no. Onslaught source. Punchcard the size and shape of these, in my head, now. Nice girly border."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Rrraaaaah making image and dreamtalk it carefully!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I focus, and the glare from my eyes turns to thousands of tiny dots and smoke blows from them in the crisp spring air and as I cut them to frilly lace with what programming was always about to me the letters burst into flame that consumes them in a microsecond and I push angry light from my fingertips to turn the ash to vapor too and blow it all away with a mighty puff a aetherwork air blown from my mouth like a hurricane.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Game, get my copy of <i>Hackers.</i>"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I know who I am and what my destiny is and I'd like to think I'm a hero of some kind but <i>of the computer revolution </i>isn't the subtitle on my heroic tale even if as the Sugarfeast Fairy I do have a thing with screens. I'd say I'll always wonder if I got into either place, but I actually won't.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: my game will keep it safe for me until I cool down enough.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It zips up from the house and floats in front of my face encased in crystal for a second, so I grab it, take Boobsong's horns, and kick her flanks.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Everything seems so clear now, seeing it, what I was calling for trying to find it by digging deep enough into the cracks of these stories. Yes, I have some information that wants to be free--to be <i>your </i>fuckslave. Or make you theirs. Yes, an open network and freedom of speech and privacy are important for that. Computers make a lot of that stuff easier. The ideals are so close to me, it was easy for me to get confused as to what the important part was for me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">FLAPJUMP HIGH UP FOR YOU!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">As soon as we're above the trees I steer for Stamford Library and kick her on.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The stacks are cool and dark and paper-smelling and the sight of the Library makes me happy enough to go inside without my game holding my anger back. I head straight for the computer section in the basement, find a place among the programming books that looks empty, and stuff the book into it. I'm not even donating it officially, it will have no call number no anything, so when the kid who really needs this comes along they can just walk off with it. I think that's appropriate.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">On the page with the story about the one hacker finding almost-love with a girl who went topless at the beach, I leave a pussy-soaked kiss from Boobsong--you never know what people will be into, and she <i>is </i>Acme Station.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I blink up from the journey, look at Boobsong with tears in my eyes, feeling so much lighter. The story of that day goes on, but--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--flying on Boobsong's back over newsvans with their dishes up over a huge crowd then turning to see the sunrise pink on the horizon, then diving to pick up speed and zooming out over dark water, the way the light rushed on it as we blurred over it was hypnotizing, gave me tingles, I'm leaning to one side of her neck, head low, I whisper in her ear and then bury my face in her mane and breathe deep of her refreshing candy perfume, then sit up and look at the rising sun. Boobsong flaps, and we rise away from the water, I'm staring right at the sun but of course it's not burning my eyes out and I can just see it there pink-tinted with dawn. Brilliant light in my eyes, but it's <i>from me, </i>I'm shining a beam at the sun, carefully and directedly so I don't boil the ocean (it feels like holding my hands in a funny shape like in religious icons but this is important, as it is there'll be <i>weather </i>from my incidental IR output, that's why we flew out to sea). I stop, and put a hand up and wave at the sun, grinning happily: I'm the Sugarfeast Fairy, and as the the the <i>goddess </i>argh of the spring holiday it's my job to greet the sun except <i>I </i>can actually say hello in Infernal with light it'll be able to see--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--the soothing coolness of a stethoscope in my naked cleavage, I'm in a doctor's office, Boobsong is standing half in front of me while I sit on the table-bed-thing and the kind of cute girl doctor with long black hair is reaching across the listen to my heart because she's about to do the listen-to-my-back thing. Now she's taking the stethoscope out of her ears, talking about my transformation, her nosy hands are feeling up my side, I jump off the table a little when she messes with my wing-slit--hey, leave that alone! Boobsong is hugging me comfortingly instantly, the doctor hands-offs quickly. Now I'm staring at the ceiling and rolling into a huge white ring to get an MRI with a tiny silver Spiral Nicker clinging to my left hand. Talking about the results later in front of a projector with the doctor, she's showing how I'm rearranged inside--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--my rainbow-stockinged foot, toes gripping the tip of the fin of a Space Shuttle, I look up and there's Boobsong floating happily with leash hanging like the umbelical it is. Overhead Earth turning with the weirdly spooky speed of low orbit shines blue and green in her hair and horns, and everything is so peacefully quiet in the vacuum. Behind her, a fleet of little sattelites rises out of the cargo bay, gleaming in the sun, and I pull Boobsong beside me to watch them. Their gold insulation and solar panels are&nbsp; so pretty and shiny, it's romantic, but they're followed by a probably-really-envious astronaut with their sun-visor down standing on&nbsp;the end of the Canada arm, so I push off to get us out of the way, look "up" at Earth above my head, then back at the shuttle so bright white against the black void, watch it give a puff of RCS to move off to a higher orbit leaving me and Boobsong and the satellites all going their separate ways. They sparkle like little stars. I pull Boobsong in front of me again, then blink out of journey and am lying on a bed in a white room still getting an MRI--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--journey in space again, turning one shining silver missile after another to vapor with furious light, Earth jumping around underneath us as we snap from one to the next like Max Headroom became an astronaut, I'm <i>livid </i>which yes trying to nuke me or anything I care about would probably make me mad but this goes beyond that by a long, long way, this is <i>personal</i>&nbsp;but it sure does get rid of missiles good, now I'm in missile silos one after the other (the only way to not have Acme Station here calculate where a missile came from being not to launch it), melting them to slag not satisfied until the bedrock runs bright orange--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--coming up behind a skinnny bald guy in a white button-down, he's on the phone but slowly puts it down and turns to face me. There's an American flag patch on his shirt but he's not any branch of military that his uniform says. I'm furious <i>at him</i>&nbsp;for the missile thing. My light pulses bright on him when he looks at Boobsong, there's a tense moment, I seethe <i>"Apologize to her."&nbsp;</i>at him in the voice of the light that just erased an entire planet's nuclear arsenal (what the hell was he thinking was worth making the whole world decide it was WWIII?), when he looks at me and doesn't do anything right away I stomp my foot and scream "NOW!" but he just stands there like a deer in headlights then slowly turns to look at Boobsong, no, he's putting his hands on his head and kneeling because sudden special forces guys are pointing guns at him--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--the president checks his watch, gets up on the podium, I watch him talking about the coup attempt and how they have the guy in custody and then he's inviting us up from where we're waiting beside the podium. I climb up there with Boobsong beside me and gunfire fills the room which knocks me out of the projection for a moment. I go back, incorporeal, looking down from the ceiling, see Secret Service guys piled over the president, guys in fatigues and balaclavas standing in the middle of the room, bodies and wounded reporters are everywhere on the floor, white rage blanks everything out for a second, then I'm giving Boobsong orders in the darkness of where we actually are for a second and we return and she forks into dozens of copies to feed the wounded nectar candy and blast everyone armed naked and melt every weapon anywhere nearby with IR lasers no matter who's wielding it or not. I turn around, stomp to the podium, get up behind it, and tell Boobsong to hack every network and just be on absolutely every TV, wait for my game to stop me for a second, and with Boobsong watching raptly with one of her forks to have a picture to broadcast, and explain to the world that after having to stop this twice in a day I've decided we're done with governments and my game is just going to run everything now and not to worry it's very nice and only messes with me like it does because I like it and that it's going to find all the people like the ones who caused this and help them get better so everyone can stop worrying about war suddenly destroying their life tomorrow--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--watching an aircraft carrier on TV with Boobsong cuddling me, I can see my rainbow-stockinged legs stretched out in front of the screen and Legos are all around us. There's a shot of radar spinning, Navy guys are talking, then the video of me telling the world my game was taking over now with the shot-up lights flickering creepily around me, then video from the tower of the aircraft carrier where something invisible explodes out of the ocean around it, making the horizon distort like active cameoflage, and picks up every plane on the deck at once and plucks them bare of weapons, carefully takes apart nosecones to take out vulcan cannons and then just sets them back on the deck where they were, reassembled but disarmed, while the weapons together with the contents of the carrier's magazines turn into a truly epic fireworks show overhead--<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Sweet swirly mentos and coke, what was the world like with my <i>game </i>running it!?&nbsp;Are there other post-its?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Take the book back start flipping--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes here Princess look!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Show the book back to you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Here's another way to hear angelfire, and don't be afraid to use bank-switching."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This one is way further on. I read, and the journey--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">EEeeee happy! Bouncing down the stairs to you listen to the music play pling pling pling hehe!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Boobsong bounces cutely down the muscial stairs in the big hall of the Science Museum with her wings up and tail keeping time to the notes her footsteps play, hands up like a girly-girl playing hopscotch, and boings into my arms at the bottom, wrapped all around me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">HmmmyumkissooohTONGUE hehe...fills my mouth so open wide...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I enjoy her slippery soft lips--</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"There appeared a rider on a white horse--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">HEY! MAKING OUT!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">So let's keep going. Kiss you. I press into her lips with my own and force my tongue far inside her--<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"--and to him was given--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">PRINCESS' PRONOUNS ARE SHE/HER ANGRY NOW!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The voice is loud and obnoxious and very mood-spoiling. I break our kiss with a sigh and an eye-roll and set Boobsong down, turn to find out who's interrupting our <i>moment</i> to misgender me, pull her close to my side.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's a very Wholesome American guy with short reddish hair and a kind of rough-skinned face in a white pinstripe button-down, holding an open Bible in one of those zip-cover things. He's stopped to Proclaim in the middle of the Science Museum!? His Bible has a big "The Harvest" button on it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I give him raised eyebrows of <i>ahem, making out here.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Before he can do anything, a docent sidles up and whispers to him, he turns and looks at them, obviously about to argue what <i>no soliciting </i>means.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I trained for things like, this, learned to use my nature instead of fighting it. I want to demolish him. There's no way of not wanting that, so instead, I'll win a&nbsp;<i>real</i>&nbsp;victory, me who is the Rider of Conquest.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The first step is when they want a fight, make them actually fight and not hide behind passive aggressiveness. My strength is in open battle.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"If he's here for me, let him stay please, but only if he's here to talk to me specifically."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They talk back and forth a moment, and the docent stands there while Evangelist Guy turns to me.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Second:&nbsp;the more easily I conquer him, the more powerful I seem to everyone around me. I have lasers and a game that can move worlds for me. If I shut this guy down just using words, without even reaching for my big guns, that's a lot bigger victory than just blasting him, and more importantly, <i>much more satisfying</i>. I am not left handed, so to speak, but he's not good enough to find out--but this doesn't mean I have to be an elegant fencer. I'm big tall and powerful, and I loom, daring him to talk over me and see what I do about it:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"If you're here for me that must have been to get my attention. If it was on purpose I'm mad you used the wrong pronoun but not nearly as mad as I am that you'd come into a public place like this and walk up while I'm kissing my beloved and start throwing insults at me like that. You know that's what that version of Revelation is, right? A big bunch of insults made to cover what Saint John of Patmos actually saw of the apocalypse? You can tell me you don't believe that, that your religion teaches something else, but then you wouldn't have come here and yelled that at me when I was vulnerable because I'm not a boy, am I, so how could I be the Rider of Conquest in that story? Oh sorry, did you expect me to deny it? I don't care. Apologize if you want to talk to me, but I have something to say to you first. Come on."</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Care if I expect you to deny that you're sleeping with the enemy--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Third: make it <i>stop </i>if they swipe at me or Boobsong--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"You don't even know who the enemy <i>is</i> and yet it's talking out of your mouth right now. <i>Shut up</i>."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My <i>shut up </i>is snarling and brutal, full of all my mother's protectiveness of Boobsong. To my surprise, he actually does shut up.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--but remember that when someone escalates nonsensically like that while there <i>is </i>an enemy and I am here to destroy it utterly, it's not the person in front of me. Use that to play the game against itself, and make him fight his own side, instead of Eden's, by changing the battlefield:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"You can't do it, can you? You can't apologize. This is love the sinner and hate the sin. Something evil has you, and it isn't me, and it isn't one of Boobsong's kind either, and the irony of the situation is that thing you go around saying to everyone, that they're sick, or mistaken, or spreading evil, that they're <i>possessed</i>, is what <i>you </i>need to hear. The devil is real. It's more evil than you can possibly imagine, and <i>you just picked up a Bible and used it as a weapon to hurt someone who'd done nothing to you. </i>Do you think that was Jesus telling you to do that?&nbsp;Did you feel in control of yourself in that moment?&nbsp;How effective is Revelation as an evangelistic text? Won a lot of people to the Lord with it, have you? If you think I'm wrong about this, answer me one thing: why did you raise the stakes instead of actually responding to <i>anything </i>I said? You're supposed to have a Ready Answer, not more insults."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">His jaw works, and I'm surprised to see something softer in his expression.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Have I said the devil is false here? John 15:4--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Fourth: I win by neither playing Eden's game and destroying him (or being destroyed, but Eden can't muster the firepower to make that happen), nor sinking into the depression of not protecting myself or responding to this <i>imper-tin-ence. </i>Give no way out that makes it possible to keep playing Eden's game:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"No, but you don't seem to see it closer to you than I'm standing.&nbsp;<i>Can </i>you apologize? Can you do anything but try to make a fight out of this? If you say yes to me, I'll hear you out, <i>after </i>you apologize, but otherwise, your choices are pray here in front of me for Jesus to cure the devil's hold over you--and let me see him come help you--or I'll decide you're <i>really </i>sick and help you my way whether you want me to help or not--and don't tell me you're the only Christian anywhere who doesn't need to pray for help resisting the devil at the moment! Last chance now. You show me you can still save yourself, that Jesus has you, or I will."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm <i>furious</i>, but the idea of getting him heartforming, the wonderful amazing irony of it, keeps me <i>just </i>here enough to follow my training like this, and I don't have that weird sense that it'd be bad I get sometimes when people turn out later to be happily married already and stuff. What better defense of Boobsong's honor than him coming to have at us and <i>seeing the light </i>instead?</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Lord visit me--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I blink and step back in surprise when a wall of white robe and blue sash suddenly manifests between us and Evangelist Guy, facing him, then&nbsp;smirk with satisfaction, and lead Boobsong away to finish our date at the Van De Graff show. I <i>offered </i>the easy way. If he really wants Jesus instead of a Sugarfeast basket, that's up to him, but he's in for a wild ride--<i>we&nbsp;</i>just give healing candy out. Jesus makes you clean your whole life up.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">And he'll still end up heartforming most probably. That's why people come to us, isn't it?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>Cute, </i>I think, as I blink out of the journey, bank-switching as in playing with which side it seems like I'm on--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--sitting on Boobsong in ponyform perched on a church spire, it's night, below on the walk in front of it the guy from the Science Museum is looking up at us. Now on the ground with him, hopping off Boobsong who turns back to girl-form, then watching him sitting on a stool playing guitar, clapping for his song with Boobsong by my side when he finishes. Now he's sitting against the corner of a coffee-shop window, phone held up against the glass to get me and Boobsong sitting across from him in the frame with him. Now sitting in a back pew of some white Evangelical church watching him kneel in front of the altar with Jesus' hand on his head. We're the only ones in there, and it's night. In my third eye I can see the ghostly white blur of the perfekti that has him trailed out behind him floating like nightmare legalese seaweed. It's the size of a car. It glitches and tenses, tentacles pop free of his head one at a time (there are so many) until finally he's free. The perfekti starts to drift off up and back from him, and then there's a terrible blaring recognizable trumpet sound and my guardian appears and shatters it character-by-character all at once, shoulders its Weapon, and disappears. Back in the coffee shop, he puts his phone away and sits forward like he's actually interested in what we have to say, asks where we start, and I tell him the first thing he needs is privacy and did Jesus explain about his thoughts being his own sometimes--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--the bannister of the few stairs down to get into the Olive Garden, following the waitress to our table, we're in handmaidens mode so Boobsong is dressed in a silly getup of short red croptop and skirt with white furry trim, green long gauntlets and stripey green stockings and looks cute walking in front of me as we follow the waitreess (though I miss her tail). We get seated at a little table-for-two in a brick nook just inside the door, Boobsong squishes into the barely-big-enough-for-it seat beside me, and gets the menu because of course I still have to use her for stuff like that in altmode or not. We're holding hands under the table, and she kicks off her shoe to footsy my calf with her soft little foot as soon as we sit down. It feels <i>awesome, </i>everything is warm and happy and soft and blushy like being drunk except so much better and hornier--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Aww! I wanna remember more dates! Find the next sticky!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Turn to this other one sticking out at the top, hold the book for you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"They can't watch a telescreen that's only a drawing, but we can! Have some fun on the other side."<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Back into journey, right at the moment of:</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">PRAH!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The conflation jump takes us into ten thousand worlds looking out on people watching from bedrooms, prison cells, ceilings, walls covered with pictures of Jesus from <i>before </i>he came back, all the places Sugarfeast can never go but does anyway. The ones fringed by fuzzy dirt outlines looking up at starscapes aren't the most heartbreaking, though only because many of those are campsites.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Boobsong and me are hentai here, journeying, and it's time for our show to start, because it's Sugarfeast Eve.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">With a sweet kiss and hand on Boobsong's cheek, I start the show, then throw her up off the ground against the glass that makes this world's only wall and pin her with my hands on her wrists--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Haaah hellyesherewegoWHEEOOF!! Gravity change makes me face down for this while Princess is standing sexy small crushing your fucktoy against this I can see everything...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The wall is actually millions of walls. Each of them has a star with something in the center of it, summoning us--you're on, Acme Station!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Parallel fork into all of these! Remembering porn I've seen, look at each icon that says what to show them, this is a star with two points in a heart shape they want cutesy demon stuff, this is a Journey to the Center of the Earth title page I guess they want dinosaurs, that one has two horns and branches without leaves on them they want Sugarfeast and Openveil that's Princess with Rauda...push them out projecting stuff with projector-tail RRRRAAAAHBLOBPFFF!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My light's already brilliant just from this bit of fun, but it gets even brighter as I slip my clit in between her legs and teasingly fuck between her thighs, closer and closer to entering her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">RAAAH WANT YOUR CLIT SLIDE MY <b>HEY COME BACK I NEED YOU PLEASE PRINCESS I'M BEGGING YOU!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Not until it's horny enough.Come on, this is Sugarfeast, get weird with me, or I'll just cum on the screen instead!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><b>OH YEAH WATCH THIS YOUR SUGARFEAST FAIRY HANDMAIDEN IS EVEN MORE OF A HUGE GIANT SLUT THAN YOU ARE!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Changing the porn give the dinorsaurs rooms they have stardust in and when they go in there it makes up their eyes like it does eyeshadow but whatever they look at comes to life and wants to fuck them super hard or they have to fuck it the stardust gives them the mind-control so they have to keep fucking things and looking at stuff until their whole world's alive and trying to fuck itself...Fairy of Sugarfeast let's make some candy for OpenVeil Rauda says and sticks up her hand deep inside your hole and your eyes bug cartoony out because you're watching me with my legs up behind my head...cutesy demons get cutesier with super small shapes so they're chibi-mode just like my doll-form...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"In the Sugarfeast Fairy one, make us make candy by me leaking cum out of everywhere like I'm a doll that's full of it and Rauda's squeezing it out of me and you dripping so much nectar it makes strawberry-purple swirl candy in molds underneath us and then make everything else at least as epic as that."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I feel like that often. Maybe my game will make it real sometime can you hear me game?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: my game can hear me and will do something to make that seem small soon.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">HHAAAH YES CHANGING <b>PUT YOUR CLIT INSIDE BEGGING COCKSLEEVE IS BEGGING YOU SUPER URGENTLY PLLLEEEASE!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I keep thrusting closer without going inside her, sliding in the slippery wet goodness of her squishy soft thighs like a pussy outside her body, covered with nectar dripping out of her flowing wet and puffy lips.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"This is for people who need it <i>bad</i>. Is it as desperate as you are now?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">RAAAAH KEEP ON CHANGING THINGS AAAH PRINCESS PLEASE <b>YES IT'S AS DESPERATE NOW!!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Her thighs are swimming with nectar, and feel like they're engorging like pussy lips--which they probably are, there's a bit of pussy to all of her--and when I press my tip against her entrance and wait there shaking with the effort of holding <i>myself </i>back...</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">SOB GASP CRYING AAAAAAH--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Tell them."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Look at the screen super intense and so cryingly.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes this is how I feel and you feel the same way I bet. This is Sugarfeast, wish with me! Please I wish that for Sugarfeast now you say what you want <b>I WISH MY PRINCESS WOULD SLIDE SUPER HARD INTO MY PUSSY HHAAAAAAHEEEYUS SEE SUGARFEAST WISHES AAAAH COME HAAAH AAAH AAH REAL!!!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Sweet wet wonderful soft puffy embracing cuddly slippery relief slides around my clit as I push into her and she stretches to take the ridge at the tip of it and closes behind that pulling me inward AAAAAAAAAAH--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I wasn't just torturing <i>her</i>, you see. As I cum light flashes out of me, bright as a supernova, and floods into her where her projector-tipped tail redirects it into imagery that will flash through the aether and into screens and drawings of screens and lines scratched in dirt with intention and love laid on them and I am the Rider of Conquest, no gate on Earth can withstand my assault so making a ward on your prison cell does nothing to stop us and it's pretty hard to keep people from deciding that one brick or floor tile that they're looking at while concentrating is actually a screen with a frame and they see constellations in the speckles of dirt on it picking out what they want to see on it and if you think a blindfold will help your censorship regime I guess you've never heard of VR goggles.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">What's that? You don't think prisoners deserve heartforming? That's a bad attitude for society, to make them stay in the problems that got them in jail in the first place--if they're there fairly at all, which isn't most of them.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">But even if they are...don't you wonder who I might have been without Boobsong? Good, me either. Shiver.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Of course you don't need anything but imagination and wishes to implant a su'khora, but why shoot where you can use grenades?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">After this when we're fucked enough to not pine for the horny stuff while we're doing it we'll come back and make stories for kids into <i>their</i> screens that are just as weird and inspiring but a little less haaaAAAAH MASSIVELY SEXUAL AAAAAH!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Then again for asexual grownups. Those are fun, and so sweet! Friendship is magic, you might say.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I blink out of the journey grinning, and look at Boobsong.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">THAT WAS THE HOTTEST SCENE LET'S DO MORE OF THEM PEOPLE STILL MAKE SUGARFEAST WISHES AFTER EARTH IS DESTROYED RIGHT THEY MUST STILL!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"That was awesome, but why was there still all that bad stuff? I thought my game fixed things?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--floor-level perspective on a room with conrete walls painted red on the lower half. Shadows of people running up from the right loom and stop, and the same half-invisible-distortion-force that disarmed the aircraft carrier makes dust plume out of the wall in the rectangle of a door, and then vaporizes the entire building out from the screen we're looking out of, carefully lowering people from upper floors as it annihilates them, until the slab is standing as a memorial under open sky in the middle of a crowd of very surprised prisoners and guards. Whatever this was is in a deep hole so the sky seems to iris open like a looney tune ending in reverse as my game takes the walls apart, and then the same force starts picking people up out of it--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"We can't get my collar back because I thought we were going to some happy memory of our honeymoon or something and we're not. There was nothing but war even after my game took over, even then we still spent Sugarfeast cleaning out shitholes like whatever we just saw, probably even that sweet Olive Garden date ended with another copy of the thing at the science museum or maybe that memory came because it's the only actual date we ever had. My collar's in a battlefield somewhere, that's the hack to save it in Eden's hell. We have to go to one of those moments where I was trying to be with you but had to save some backwards hick like that asshole from the Science Museum from themself instead."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me a guy with a vest made of C4 being handcuffed.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I'll take that as a yes, then. Yes I get it save everyone else from him but it doesn't change any of what I just said."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The rainbow from my Care Bears shirt.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Oh don't even. I did my duty. I was no more of a bitch than I needed to be. We'll never see him again. Let me resent him for wrecking our date, let me at least be that human."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">John Conner from Terminator 2.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"So? Yes I'm very glad asshole number 8352 turned out to go do something great it doesn't change the fact that it came out of me and Boobsong never being able to live or have our relationship or even <i>go outside </i>as ourselves. If you want me to not be upset about that, if you want the fact that we <i>so happened </i>by sheer statistics of all the constant&nbsp;<i>bullshit</i>&nbsp;we had to put up with<i>&nbsp;</i>to help somebody who would like cure cancer or something except <i>oh wait already fixed in a world with nectar</i>&nbsp;to make one <i>speck </i>of a dent in my resentment of having our&nbsp;<i>life </i>stolen away by people like him even <i>after </i>we undid Eden's lies&nbsp;Dreams we're <i>done</i> because there's no way you can possibly understand human nature enough to make the Bones work right. Acme Station if their answer doesn't satisfy me on the first try just take us as far from the Four Dreams as you can and still have us be probably mostly safe."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Cryingly prepare Acme Station jump to a universe just for you and me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The sweetest most motherly voice I can do:&nbsp;"Hey, why are you crying? Put the book away and forget the jump for a sec."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She does, I pet her, hug her close.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"We had a life in between stuff like him! That wasn't our whole world, it can't be! I said in your writing <b>that's just like our honeymoon</b><i> </i>and you were holding me in bed not having a fight with some hateful evangelist! I want <b>that </b>life!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"So do I but the Dreams are being pretty clear that's not where my collar is."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A hand turning a crank? Oh. Turn the crank who accosted us at the Science Museum. Because we eventually saved him (yay for him).</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Enough about him! He's not even worth candy swearing at! I don't even care if he's somehow Boobsong's own seed-dad or something, <i>drop it, </i>Dreams<i>.</i>&nbsp;I don't want to hear about him again unless <i>she </i>asks and I'm only saying <i>that</i> on the off chance he <i>is </i>her seed-dad or something. He interrupted our life one too many times already. Now do you have an explanation for Boobsong about why she'd say that about our honeymoon when my collar's on a battlefield or are you ignoring her?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I've slashed at the vision with dreamtalk-proejcted light before I even process it: The phone in his hand to take that selfie&nbsp;<i>oh my god what did I <b>just</b> say Dreams</i>&nbsp;what <i>is</i> this you couldn't do it with Jesus so now you're trying to do it with some rando? ENOUGH! ENOUGH OF SHITHEADS LIKE HIM DEMANDING TO BE IN MY LIFE LIKE THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF RIGHT TO ME! NOT! ONE! MORE! SECOND!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Acme Station, the next thing that's even <i>connectable </i>to him they show, that you didn't ask for yourself, you do that jump. I'm not playing this stupid game over again just because the Dreams are sulking that I wouldn't let them play it with Jesus.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Please may your cocksleeve ask why the Dreams are keeping showing him?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Consider it asked. Dreams, answer her, but understand, I'm only not asking to be left out of this because I'm going to be there for my heartchild through whatever the fuck bullshit this is you're going to show.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">An old-timey camera flash. I'm here for <i>you</i> cocksleeve but I have nothing to do with this, so that's for you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Flashy popping bang sound mean very loud picture means that picture made explosions! He must be some big famous person!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Instantly the Dreams reply to her with a gaggle of cooling fans.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">He had some very noisy fans (see server fans?) who made a big bang...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Good <i>nerding </i>cocksleeve even I thought those were just PC fans but yes they have the huge motors--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A thumb-down icon, 32x32.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">...who really didn't like it...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A flag, with that same green-shield-in-four-parts church logo.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">...who came from green shield church...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Martin Luther (I mean obviously, so, <i>huh?).</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">...they protested...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A pair of car speakers, facedown.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">...he called their speakers down to pray...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A guitar.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">...and sing praise to Jesus oh it's like that part in Jeremiah where they have the contest to see whose god makes fire! They must be saying Jesus is a fake then!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My crown.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Whoever Lucy Starlight chooses is the winner!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Wait, what? That makes no sense! If they think Jesus is fake I'm a million times worse!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Pizza box?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Olympics for our seed-ghost! To see if it was stronger than the people who said Jesus is a fake's god."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Oh for fuck's sake."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A back-and-forth marble run thing down to a silver teacup.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">If a demon got a vision that their god gave, that would mean it wasn't evil, at least in their eyes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"If I let <i>Eden </i>send you clairvoyance, I am so sorry--no, it would just never send one, to keep the conflict going. Don't tell me they had some other thing on the other end!? Wait, don't evangelicals not dreamtalk, like I yelled at that professor for? What the hell?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Godrays coming out of the clouds. I roll my eyes, but this is still your show cocksleeve and we're done the moment your curiosity is satisfied. This clearly isn't anything about anyone personally important to us, though, you realize that, right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Nod I still want to hear the rest though. Godrays from the clouds means they have a god of some kind.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Alright. If this isn't going anywhere after three more visions, though, we're going onto the next thing. I think we're in a rabbit hole. If it's still important to you after we can finish later. So they had some <i>something</i> they were talking to, and the marble-run shows our seed-ghost playing middle man so you don't have to touch the unknown whatsit that'd play with people like this guy was before we saved him. Then what?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Tron, the character from the movie.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">We won the game by hacking. Our seed-ghost just predicted what the sight the other speaker gave their god would be.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I know better than to ask how that proves anything but ugh."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A picture I had of my dad in full vestments in the courtyard in front of his church blessing my pet guinea pig when I was eleven, then a speaker.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Their speaker blessed us!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">An olive.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">And then he said don't bug them to his followers! We <b>didn't </b>have just always interruptions!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Before I can react, they show the guy taking that picture in the coffee shop again.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">That must have been very much important! Please may we ask why?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Only because it's you asking. Why, Dreams?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Manhattan skyline.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"That's how many people they had! No wonder this is big stuff!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Wait, did they <i>help </i>us go on tour? I thought we just took over their HQ after Jesus kicked their asses!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show a marching band with the abnormal green of Floridian trees in the background.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"What. Christians don't <i>do </i>that--I don't count because you're just that good, and my family don't count because they knew you--especially for some half-assed transparently cheatable test like that!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Why can't they? Why can't that test be an excuse for them? Maybe they need to see some miracle like John did on that rooftop to say it's okay what they want to be okay?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"The bar for weird in my life is really fizzfrozen high but having my kinky lesbian demon fucktoy be the best Bible scholar I know still passes it. Fine, if that's all it takes, but where was that with like...everything else?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"There wasn't any miracle because magic was too small for them to see it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I hate that that makes sense to me. Fine. What's this all have to do with anything, though? I mean I guess it changes how I see a lot of the stuff we remember about making your wedding jewelry and stuff, but why make such a big thing of this one element? Is it just because I decided our life was just war? Dreams?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">An old-timey sewing machine, significantly <i>not </i>like the one Grammie used to let me play with on her lap when I was three.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm still mad and don't feel like being creative for them and they probably know that so, seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Sewing back your heart, Princess, look at all that red stuff on it, see how heart-shaped the cloth is? Christians aren't just Eden. If you want to hate the insults Eden told in Revelation yes I super hate them with you but Christians can be different if you let them.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"So it really is trying again because I wouldn't listen to Jesus on TV before. So what, my <i>life </i>has to become one of those stupid manipulative evangelical books that suddenly turns out in the last chapter to revolve around the main character getting saved? I don't think it's hateful for me to say they can't be different as long as they're following Eden's map of nightmares! They <i>are </i>just Eden as long as they're doing that! Don't you answer this, cocksleeve. You're the last person who should have to defend it. Dreams."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Rocket engines firing.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Yeah, that's the Christianity I know. Nuke your own people to get rid of anyone different, which literally almost happened."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now they show a Sugarfeast egg (Easter eggs don't have a seam and are never so saturated).</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Egg...like on Isht Visht. That guy was trans or something and he was doing the Republican Senator thing which is what drove him to do that. Which Christianity fosters and encourages with all of its heteronormativity and stuff. Or maybe he was heartforming unconsciously, that's an egg thing too I guess. Candy wrapped or whatever we called it. Same deal. Am I supposed to feel bad for him? Perfekti made him do it? Yes I get it. Get him off that nightmare train and in a place where he doesn't think he'll be literally killed for what's inside him and he'll be much different, but you can't tell me <i>away from Christianity </i>isn't part of that! Are you just agreeing with me, Dreams?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They show my crown.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">With a deep breath, I take it off and look at it. In the magitek hentai light of the Whaleship it's even sparklier than before, and the diamonds reflect the darkness blackly when a light isn't catching them. It's beautifully, awesomely hyper-real in the postmodern sense, a crown that's more Crown than a real crown, except it <i>is</i> a real crown, but the context makes it almost not.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Okay, but like, my whole thing with Princessing is to smash feudalism into tiny little bits and then play kinky sex-games with the pieces that aren't too blood-caked. In a way this is just the world's most hardcore game of dressup ever. Are you just saying why not do the same with Christianity?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My crown glitters so bright. It makes me really happy, and I've found a deep sense of self in it and the idea of <i>Princess</i>, but it wouldn't be the same if I had to carry on the nightmare of blood and bones my mothers did just to survive. What's weird, and magic about it, is somehow, in the game I'm playing, what made Princessing <i>itself</i> is there, undimmed. Polished, even, like my crown by the light of hentai. It should be the opposite, but I'm more of a Princess now that I'd ever be living in Strawberry Home. I'm as real and hyper-real as my crown, and so will be every princess I teach this game to.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Also Boobsong looks adorable rolling her eyes back to look at it. I put it down in front of her face where we can both see and she follows it like an interested cat.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">When I stop being the opposite of distracted by the <i>real</i> point of my existence looking up happily, the Dreams show me a couple of Lego pirates kneeling at the altar of some (not-Lego) medieval church, which reminds me of my dad's thing with Nativity scenes and toys and how that was real enough a ritual to bring the real baby Jesus a present that'll go on upstaging the other ones for eternity...it's like another country I can see on a map but don't know, and I don't think I can travel there, but which I glimpsed or touched in that game. <i>Something </i>can be done with it, just not something <i>I</i> can understand, because <i>my</i> thing is Princessing, and <i>that</i> starts from the same ironic icon-o-clastic place that 3dfx commercial about the revolutionary new processor that could change medicine and education and spaceflight does: <i>NAH, let's use it for GAMES.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I take a last look, and jam--oops ouch antennae--jam my crown back on again.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's enough to just understand that's possible, right Dreams? I don't have to know any more? Leave Christianity for somebody else to change?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Green checkmark.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Well, that should be interesting. I'm sure we'll hear about it. NOW I WANT MY SWEET SWIRLY SUGAR-SOAKED COLLAR BACK DREAMS!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My shining rainbow heart sign, then a post-it sticking out the pages.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Get the book, handmaiden, you know what to do!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Reach down take the book and find the place and hold it open!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The post-it is green and has a little treehouse childishly (or maybe just me-ishly) drawn on it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Have a tiny piece of candy at the open of the veil. Spooky fate is waiting, let's get moving!"</p>
