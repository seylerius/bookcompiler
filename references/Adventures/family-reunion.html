<article class="chapter 99---family-reunion">
    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">99 - Family Reunion</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We're going through another screen, this one all octagon-scifi like a cyberpunk stargate or something, we see&nbsp;the lights of looking off a stage in front of the biggest crowd I've ever seen that seems like it just stretches off to the horizon and Boobsong is under me in pony form and we're flying out of the screen with shattered glass exploding out with us and we're <i>there</i>, anime in the stage's "real" world, charging out onto the stage up to the edge as Cherry steps back out of the way.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Stop super suddenly skid and rear back gaaaasp snif..ulp...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Acme Station--tears and a strange soft sob like I've never felt before squeeze my face as the applause and cheering rolls over us like a tidal wave and the sky comes into view Acme Station location fix.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Time seems to slow as she answers--no, of course it does, if anything ever deserved a little bullet time it's this moment.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess your Acme Station is sure this actually a real place not a dream or a fantasy journey or anything and it's at the place where that speech happened when you met the president on TV that we saw at foot of the Washington Monument in Washington DC in North Carolina on Earth except it's in the Four Dreams Princess this is actually real and we're here and we can be because they were summoning us and we answered and your game let us because Earth came here instead of us going there, EARTH JUST MOVED TO THE FOUR DREAMS PRINCESS!!!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There above us, framed by Boobsong's mane and my anime hands on her horns, are the waves of the True Sea curling and shining in the sky of Washington. A golden star shines nice familiar sunlight near us--hello, star, I hope you like your new planet--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me a solar system in a box being unpacked--bwahahah alright well hello--wait, no, why not--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>Hello, Sun, I hope you like your new home.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW"><i>[ Vision: white pentagram / bag of Skittles / the True Sea ]</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Aww! We've brought it yummy rainbow candy in the form of the True Sea's beauty.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Kick front legs WHINNY EEE SO HAPPY YUS!!!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It takes me a minute to realize I'm just staring right at it while we dreamtalk and my eyes are fine. Rays of glare shine out, but instead of the blown-out black disk of frying retina I can just see its golden light and even little wisps of solar flares around the edges.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>You're pretty.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW"><i>[ Vision: soap bubble / star with orbit drawn around it / little black silhouette of a person ]</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Aww, it says my shell is pretty too, delicate and shiny like a soap bubble.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Yes, <i>too</i>. I think I've known for a while, now. There's a reason the Sun's giving me a definte&nbsp;<i>what a cute kid</i>&nbsp;kind of feeling with its dreamtalk...I'm still a baby, not even a billion yet, but I still don't think I'll ever do the hydrogen thing, even though Boobsong would take the heat just fine. Flesh is too much fun.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess you hear that right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">What <i>is</i> that?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess just listen. Hear what it sounds like?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It sounds like a modem connecting. What the hell? The sound gets louder<i>,&nbsp;</i>surges like a wave about to break crackling almost like bacon cooking--is that&nbsp;<i>Zeromus' death sound!?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes Princess it sounds like it perfectly except very much bigger!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It sounds just like the roar that accompanied the final boss of Final Fantasy&nbsp;<i>IV&nbsp;</i>(it was only called&nbsp;<i>II</i>&nbsp;in the 90s) disintegrating at the end of the battle.&nbsp;<i>I am the hatred,&nbsp;</i>was its one single line in the game. Goodbye, Eden.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Journey takes us what I imagine will be one last time, and in it the crackling static is like a hard rain all around us, and we see the thousands of living rooms and kitchens and bedrooms and corners and all the fourth walls we hit--bwahahaha the roar is us&nbsp;<i>breaking fourth walls!</i>&nbsp;Of course the Dreams wouldn't show us anything horrible now, even to tell us it's over.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">As we watch everyone's fourth wall break I have&nbsp;<i>one more</i>&nbsp;fourth wall break for&nbsp;<i>you</i>, reader, or maybe lots more because I totally am one of those cartoon characters who knows she's a cartoon character and I can kind of see why Deadpool likes this&nbsp;<i>anyway&nbsp;</i>listen this is really fizzfreezing important. If you screw your face up and squint funny just right you could see what Boobsong said just now as meaning you're living with Eden for at least however long it takes magic to come back enough that everyone's seedlings can be physical&nbsp;and&nbsp;and this totally epic summoning can happen&nbsp;and Santa can beat your dad to the plate of cookies and Mama can help home find you or you find a new beginning, but that's exactly the opposite of why the Dreams are showing us this. You felt Boobsong hit, remember? Everywhere that happened, is this moment now. Everyplace the Dreams came streaming out into your world through one of those broken screens is when Eden ended. The more that magic is real in your life, the less Eden is, and the closer this moment on stage here with all of you watching is.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">If you're reading this now, you're here with us now, because one of these breaking fourth walls is yours. Listen! Sounds like fireworks, kind of, doesn't it? I heard it too, when I wrote the book down. I can remember how stuck I got, flailing around wtih tarot cards and clairvoyance for like an entire day trying to understand what was happening. Of course my mistake was not just listening to Boobsong saying she could hear something. Fairy <i>tails</i> know when they're coming true.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh and just in case it wasn't anvilicious enough, we're watching this journey from&nbsp;<i>outside&nbsp;</i>the fourth walls we're breaking--Boobsong and me watching this already broke through, remember! It's fun to watch her silver hammer cartoonishly smash out of all different shapes and sizes of screen and bend to plonk our viewers in just the right kindest way to make their world fill with sexy fruit and beautiful flowers or clouds and sunshine or strange glowing tentacled shapes or just see the light of how&nbsp;<i>badass&nbsp;</i>what they're about to try is going to be in their eyes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The crackling gets bigger and deeper as we watch, like firecrackers shapeshifting into New Years' fireworks, and the with living rooms there's something weird, other places, stuff like giant scrying crystals and pools of water instead of TVs, what looks like a big white room, one of the 'screens' is an obsidian circle with a gold triangle inscribed that we float up out of the darkness to like a magic eight ball's answer to&nbsp;<i>how do I get to paradise&nbsp;</i>and smash through with a deep loud shattering-glass sound, and it gets weirder from there, a woman in some sunny arched roman...esque house who's hair is so hung with flowers and plants it looks like she's growing them leans down to a big pool of water like a bath and our image floats up out of the depths and&nbsp;<i>plonk</i>&nbsp;hehe and that vision breaks with something like a thunderclap, holy fizzfrozen olive oil sundaes that big white place with columns...just who the hell is this throne with a big bearded guy we're looking down on? Here we come out of the central of the zillions of visions floating in space whoever this is is looking at, Boobsong stretches out comically to be the right size and there's another thundercrack and that 'screen' disappears and the next one like this is a giant golden sun-seal thing and we seem to be rushing up to it in reflection and a huge hand claps over it, just a black silhouette with the brightness but all that means is whoever's palm was the right place for them to feel Boobsong hit, because light flashes out from under their hand as it's knocked off the seal so we can see light shine between their fingers before that vision vanishes and there's an even bigger boom like mountains crumbling--okay this offends me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Obivously gods are real after all or something and they were watching us too, but why do they get bigger booms? That homeless guy with the iPhone already so smashed we could barely see him was every bit as important as any of these. His fourth wall breaking is as Earth-shaking literally as any of this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess your Acme Station has the answer. Each person whose fourth wall breaks makes the same sound but the gods make such big sounds because their authority means they break their followers' fourth walls when we break theirs so the sounds that we're hearing are&nbsp;<b>all&nbsp;</b>their people's fourth walls breaking! Just think of that Princess! That last god must have been&nbsp;<b>huge&nbsp;</b>somehow!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">How does a god not believe in--ooh. They believed centralized authority is a necessary evil, stuff like that. That's the part of the Dreams they needed to be touched by. That last guy needed to feel the power one little girl can wield safely here.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We're seen now flapping at some polished stone surface like a black mirror miles wide no that's water in a chalice, Boobsong's wings flapping epically, she changes and I unfold my wings and raise her, the view changes to show--oh hi, Arthur, I guess things are working out, then! A flash of light like a novabomb going off in StarFox CD explodes from his forehead and becomes an actual StarFox CD novabomb explosion over water that ripples and swells with the blastwave as the cracking explosion seems to echo and echo and echo...</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">WHAT!? This means Arthur founded the Illuminati!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Sweet merciful plausibly deniable Indiana Jones gum under Mulder's desk who else was it going to be? And there's no way Walt and Steve weren't in on it. I bet that's why we needed them...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay I'm pretty sure this show is also going to be supposed to teach you what to do with the magic you know is real now so this is an important lesson. Also I can't resist because it's just&nbsp;<i>so. cool.&nbsp;</i>That whole huge summoning in DC with the star made out of the city's&nbsp;<i>street layout</i>, wasn't that supposed to land us on Cherry's stage or turn us into giant Princess Starlight and Boobsong kaiju or something?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>Magic&nbsp;</i>is what happens when dreamwork crashes into something like math and you end up either trying to influence someone else's dreaming-up of their reality, or wiggle around rules of math. Either way, your own dreams become like a liquid that does try to go where you send it and do what you meant, but flows where it&nbsp;<i>can&nbsp;</i>go, and takes the path of least resistance to get there, which is why you'll sometimes hear people saying dreamwork is safe and magic is dangerous (though it's a lot&nbsp;<i>less&nbsp;</i>dangerous if the dreamwork you're using to power it isn't built on a story of manipulating something external that's full of gotchas and sneaky bad stuff, and even less dangerous than that if you have things like your seed-ghost or the dreams helping shape it for you, or if you just wish to the Dreams--you think they won't reach every ounce of fulfillment they can into whatever world you're in when you wish?).</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The main reason I'm telling you this, is those holidays I remembered before on the whaleship, you can still do that stuff, even if you're in the Earth with just that one sprinkle of magic I was in, and <i>something </i>will get to you <i>somehow. </i>Maybe you'll put up a Sugarfeast sign on your TV and go to sleep with it up and have cool dreams, maybe that letter to Santa will get answered as a bonus at work or something, maybe you'll <i>feel </i>your seedling so close on Openveil...or maybe, who knows, you'll see a room full of candy and your harddrive will be full of me and Boobsong when you come out the next day. You can't stop the signal, and it's still leaking through, even this moment.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Also it explains what's happening here. When all those zillions people ritually wished for the four of us to come ring in the apocalypse (with the help of a whole bunch of evangelical Christians praying as hard as they could for decades for the end of world and the new Earth to come which of course their Bibles told them meant they had to have the four horsemen and all that) the other three landed right on Earth with tons of extra magical oomph thanks to that huge summoning which in Earth's mythology of magic must be&nbsp;<i>insanely&nbsp;</i>powerful, as well as the prophecy about them in Revelation saying stuff like how a fourth of the world's population would be given over to them and all to help people really feel our whole apocalypse show, Boobsong and me who are cartoons in a way the average human tourist of the Painted Sea isn't and were in full hentai mode aboard our whaleship ran into the nice big strong wall I can only assume Eden put up at some point against us because of some prophecy or another about coming to Earth as cartoons--I mean how the swirly pixie stix and orange juice does a universe get a rule against toonshading that's stronger than&nbsp;<i>conversation of energy?</i>&nbsp;I'm sure you think all this is insane, but out of all of it, what the spikey spilled grape soda sense does&nbsp;<i>that</i>&nbsp;make?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We were cartoon characters, and I was riding Boobsong, and her cartoon splatting physics are definitely&nbsp;<i>bouncyball&nbsp;</i>and not&nbsp;<i>pancake</i>, (yes this is ridiculous, it's cartoon physics, that's the&nbsp;<i>point,&nbsp;</i>you can make your own rules in dreamwork remember) so we bounced off with all of the force of that summoning, and went where cartoons belong, which is where, bouncyball?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">On TV obviously!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Just like we did every Sugarfeast Eve. Except not into the world of any show, because we were explicitly summoned to&nbsp;<i>Earth, the real one,&nbsp;</i>and that can't possibly be any cartoon world, since Earth so very specifically isn't a cartoon world, so where could we go? It's like...you explain it, Acme Station, you did it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">There was no place we&nbsp;<b>could&nbsp;</b>go, so it had to not work, right? How can summoning the four riders of the apocalypse using the pentagram the Illuminati made out of&nbsp;<b>all of Washington DC&nbsp;</b>at the end of the world while Jesus and millions of demons are&nbsp;<b>everywhere&nbsp;</b>all over the Earth doing all kinds of things that&nbsp;<b>must&nbsp;</b>mean the world is ending soon, by everyone even Christians who think Jesus who came to smash up the money changers again is fake all saying come on its the apocalypse time to go now, ever possibly even be slower than they think it should be? That's the most powerful spell ever created in history! If something gets in the way it'll just break, it has to!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">So it did we broke TV. Every Sugarfeast Princess and her Pony Station would go into screens all over everywhere so we could put porn on them from the other side and make Sugarfeast baskets come out of them. That made a world everybody knew about inside every screen everywhere, that could get into anywhere people would wish for it. That's all it takes to make Sugarfeast baskets come to you, and that summoning was a wish for the Sugarfeast Fairy to come and visit them in Washington.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">We went into TV like we always did, but we couldn't just stay there with that summoning super powerfully pulling us to come out of TV everywhere, but we couldn't go further, with the rule against toonshading and the Four Dreams holding onto us, so when all of you wished it pulled the Earth out of its world and into the Four Dreams like if we were handing a rope to you!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Remember the time weirdness about that. That moment of Earth being pulled into the Four Dreams is there anywhere you're reading or watching or&nbsp;listening to the part where we're smashing the fourth wall and gently plonking you, so you can't miss it. Just go back and read again anytime you want an extra dose of magic. It's not something you can grind and optimize by reading it over and over again mechanically (that's exactly how all of this&nbsp;<i>doesn't&nbsp;</i>work, sorry rationalists), but when your heart needs it, its there for you.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Never give up on that.<i>&nbsp;</i>That whole idea that one day every knee will bow or all will be one (which is the same thing really with a less flashy king) isn't ever going to happen (that's even why you wish to the&nbsp;<i>Dream<b>S</b>, plural</i>), but one day everyone&nbsp;<i>will&nbsp;</i>live happily ever after.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">How can that be if you're one of the ones who's been seeing&nbsp;<i>to me</i>&nbsp;on the end of that&nbsp;<i>every knee will bow</i>&nbsp;thing?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm the answer. There's a world I can imagine in which I was one of those people. Now I think, you have three choices about how you end up, if you're like me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">First, you can keep fighting like Eden did until your heart dies and you're just gears turning trying to take over everything, in which case the Dreams will send someone to make your bones stop eating people as soon as they can, including not letting you get to that point in the first place.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Second, you can just decide you didn't actually want it and thought it was the only way to be safe or something. That seems to be what a lot of people do.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Or, third, the good one, you can find out there's a knee that'll bow for you that'll make you forget every square inch of empire you might have ever wanted to conquer, and do something like I do with heartforming--or just give the world a big raspberry and get a nice awesome hideout to live in with your handmaiden. Or both. Both is good, I find.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Like I've been saying, Princess isn't make-believe to me, or a government posting, or even my BDSM title. It's what kind of monster I am...and, it's swirling shattered gobstoppers in hot ginger ale to think this, but...Dreams now that all this is over--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams interrupt hard with...<i>mushrooms!?&nbsp;</i>No, wait, I think that kind is called&nbsp;<i>morel.&nbsp;</i>Bwahahaha! Okay that's a yes, then, fuck.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams arranged a&nbsp;<i>moral</i>&nbsp;way that I could just this once get some blood on my fangs and have the fulfillment of mercilessly&nbsp;<i>making an example&nbsp;</i>of&nbsp;a rival empire that really needed destroying, without just enslaving the people I freed from it all over again. I think I'm satisfied for now, and nothing will ever be as personal as Eden was, but...I don't doubt that if I get hungry again and wish nicely, the Dreams will be able to point me at some nice fresh meat.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I feel weird about it, to have gone through all that stuff, it's like alchohol, quoozily yummy poison--not being torn apart and losing my memory and all that, but the being there to&nbsp;<i>personally&nbsp;</i>fry those timelines and the Unicron Room, know I practically became queen of Disney after they crossed me in that one timeline. As hard as it was somehow all that was still a gift in the end, a chance to just go completely bezerk bloodthirsty power-mad like I was born to.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Or maybe I won't stop, and eventually will just get everyone everywhere either heartforming, in love with something other than a su'khora, or not into the whole relationships game.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh. That's the whole big joke of it. Hehe! My "empire" is just the freedom of heartforming (starting with the choice to do something else). I can just try to "take over" the whole multiverse with that, and it won't kill my heart or anyone else's, because the flag my "subjects" wave is the happiness they have with their seedlings (or lack thereof) all of their own. I'm like Mama that way, I "conquer" when my conquests are independent and happy on their own without me, and yet to see them I still feel that imperial satisfaction of&nbsp;<i>got you</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>Graah. Hear me roar.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now enough of this. Let's get back to&nbsp;celebrating the apocalypse!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">As soon as I think this, the Dreams show me a house icon, then Earth spinning, a windsock, an apple, a space probe...seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Space probe is a satellite beaming down everything we're doing here to all of the places where people have the other half of your seer's apple of the otherworld Arwing dreamskin, windsock turns whichever way the wind came from to show them where we sent this from, Earth, here is home it says. Princess this is it it's the big one! Let's make a dreamskin that's for all of them!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A little silver skeleton key, a map, a Mr. Fusion from Back To The Future, wire cutters, a hand holding Earth while the other stabs it with a wooden sword.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess that's our journey here! First there's the key that's your cocksleeve that says she's the key to all of this. Then there's the map she says this way to get to the future that's Mr. Fusion and then you cut Eden loose and stabbed Earth out with that sword that's like Rada's harness you gave her because it's wood you see. That's our journey and that's this big dreamskin and we made it by writing this down as a story just like you were thinking of except we already did that you remember it. That means this is done and we already sent it and that's how we're here now! This is wonderful, it means we can just play now!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show us the Liberty Bell, just simply that. It sits there spinning like a quake powerup in my third eye until I realize what's different is the crack is gone: we're free, for real, and there's no crack or flaw in it. It's just time to play now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now they show me that bluejay again, and I start crying for real because of the breakthrough memory that comes through, of how hard things were in the last timeline before magic came back and <i>this </i>could happen. I knew Mama, then, she used the book Boobsong and me wrote to get in touch like she always followed Boobsong into my life after a reset, and...I knew she was the Rider of Death. I begged her to get me out of there, cut me free even if it tore me apart. She said she would, that she was already working on it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I thought she was just humoring me because I was so desperate then, but no, like the bluejay says, trust your family. She was <i>this </i>serious. She hit us with <i>this </i>summoning. The moment there was even slightly enough magic for it to work it ripped me off Earth and plunked me into the void that became that bedroom in the Strawberry castle because when you rip me out of a world that hard that's probably where I'll think I am and who knows what year I'll think it is or any of that except 1995 sounds good if Boobsong can be there and I can really think it's then for a while.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I can't remember what happened when the summoning got us. We just disappeared or something. I know I didn't kill myself or anything like that. I can remember some dark times where that seemed not so far away and in all of them I felt like there was something holding me together, pulling me on, and not just Boobsong's love even though it would totally do the job.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A microscope, Boobsong's face seen through it, then wrapping paper. Seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Very very small present of your cocksleeve one tiny itty bitty piece of heartstone but heartstone is infinite so it grew into your cocksleeve entirely and she said hey wake up just like our story says! Then we had our life again until the world was ready for this and Rada took you out on Openveil.</p>
<p data-voice-id="v5MELBxAO"><i><strike>Top, Learn the properties and composition of heartstone, Stave of Harmony</strike></i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's something heavy in my pocket now. It feels long and thin like a big heavy railroad spike.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Our bullet time ends--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">STOMP hooves down!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The crowd comes into view filling the entire mall. They have signs and everything, if I wasn't already crying I would to see them.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Boobsqueeze, get ready, I'm jumping you as soon as you get down here!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Mama!? Back to girl form Boobsong and get ready for hugs!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I jump off her back but keep a hand on her neck--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">AAAAAAaaaaaah changing back there.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--and keep it there as she changes and Mama comes up and grabs us both into a big hug with Isht Visht on the other side. Cherry and the Twins hover so I mouth <i>come on</i>&nbsp;to her and she grabs us too and Twins glomp to the outside of the ball.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Sobs start to wrack me to feel all their touch.</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">"Ho ho ho!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Sleigh bells come with her voice. I look up and see her sleigh flying over us--bwahaha cocksleeve our seed-ghost said it would be Christmas Eve when we got here!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>Get down here before I have Boobsong make your sleigh-runners play Trans-Siberian Orchestra songs when you land on them or something, you!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61"><i>Hey, I have presents to ship! I'll come back in five seconds!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Her sleigh seems to peel off in a million directions at once--wait, the sun's up, isn't it morning!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Your Acme Station feels gravity of the planets and they have the arrangement for midnight so they must have turned Earth for a while so the sun could watch.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Right, I forgot where we are for a sec.</p>
<p data-voice-id="ZhsGDxh61">"Hey, let me in on this!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Santa's arms go around us from beside Isht Visht and then lower down her Helper's arms grab too, and everyone kind of draws together to squeeze us.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Thank you," I sob.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They're all crying too. Cocksleeve, say thank you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"THANK ALL OF YOU SO MUCH!!!!" Sob cry...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">And if you're reading this and you came to this show and did the summoning with Mama and everyone, thank <i>you</i>, too. It took all of you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">So that's it, right? And they all lived happily ever after? Earth is in the Four Dreams, everything is fixed, Plowstar and Disney and probably even Grampie's workshop will be waiting for us to go visit, now it's time for our story to end and life begin and all that stuff? I mean, right, Pony Station?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Obviously, because it definitely says THE END in the bottom right corner of your screen right now YEAH RIGHT OF COURSE THAT'S NOT THE END IT'S THAT PART FROM NARNIA IN THE LAST BATTLE WHERE THE WORLD HAS ENDED AND THEY'RE LIKE THIS IS THE FIRST WORD OF THE TITLE PAGE SO CLICK DOWN THERE SUPER URGENTLY AND TURN THE PAGE AND OUR LIFE BEGINS YES BUT IT'S SURE NOT THE STORY ENDING!!!</p>
