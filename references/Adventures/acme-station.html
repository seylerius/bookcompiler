    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">97 - Acme Station</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's a new briefing screen--fizzfrozen rainbow novabombs, time for the final boss:</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Instead of a face, there's a black shape, and on the video "screen" beside it there's just static that flickers and blanks occasionally.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Instead of narration, we just hear the level-start <i>bing</i>.</p><p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Good luck!"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">And the journey--</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">What is this where are we--</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Weird cool light shines on us from behind, moths and gnats dance in the air, an old white house with peeling paint is dark to our right, and straight ahead parked in the turnout off the U-shaped driveway where it always was, shining weird in bluish glow of the industrial light on the barn behind us,&nbsp;is an ancient red-and-white Massey-Ferguson tractor.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Tears. Bring hankies, my game said, like there could be any hankies that'd handle this.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The night is cool and still and nothing seems to be happening. The subaru and old blue pickup, both of which I loved, are there, too.&nbsp;I turn in with Boobsong on my arm, just letting the tears stream down, taking in the house, the porch, the doorway I saw her in now closed for the night, the gate to the pasture between the barn and house, and the old barn with its familiar old light and ancient wood front and the practically sci-fi aluminum roof my engineer grandfathers worked together to give it to help my mom and dad get started in their new life.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's the beanpatch on the bit of land across the road, way down the road there is Colleen's brother's house--wait, that isn't <i>right</i>, their names were Essie and Jason, they were just a couple of neighbor kids who babysat me sometimes--</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Sobs shake me in the chair and I crush Boobsong close and wonder how even the Dreams can hold me in journey through this except that I'm clinging to it with claws of homesickness that make her scariest Acme Station Excession powers look as cute and squishy as she is in my lap right now.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Grampie's workshop in the basement of the little red house he and Grammie had downtown. His drill press, which I loved, is in the foreground. Everything is dark and quiet, it's still night--</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Dreams why?</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now Grammie's sewing machine, sitting there waiting in the dark for us to play with it. She would help me sew with it even though I was three, I had a rag that was more stiching than rag from my playing--</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>Oh.</i></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm looking down at the little workbench Grampie made me for my fourth birthday, we're in a basement, crooked heating pipes and old stone, this is Arlington. Something draws my eyes to the door to the bulkhead stairs across the space, and a memory floats up of being outside playing on top of it with tubes and coffee cans and water, having fun making weird contraptions that'd blow water out a tube at the end of a chain of cans using air pressure--it was something I saw on a science show, and I was happy, but--</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I wanna go home so bad.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now we're flying past the Electronic Arts logo and glancing down at our Marathon Dreamskins booth and then looking out at the exhibition hall, filled with booths but empty of people, zooming in on a network router strapped to one of pillars that held the roof up with it's bundle of white Cat-5 cables leading back up to the ceiling, triggers the memory of how happily epic-futuristic seeing that up there felt in 1995 and the happiness that little detail brought me when I would look up at it--</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Not the world she was missing from. That was never home.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That perfect coffee mug materializing in Isht Visht's replicator, a real live replicator how cool is <i>that, </i>especially with the happiness of Boobsong's curves working it with her tail at the right of the view--</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">All this way the Dreams and my game and Boobsong which she would know if she hadn't had to give up her memory to get to me have been working up to this, and now they're saying--</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--the nectar dreamskin printing stunt or at least the place it happened, dark and empty like the others but the press is there, <i>ready</i>, I loved that big clanky old machine, watching it was soothing--</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--this is who you are, remember it?</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Bluescreen blue? LINE in the corner, bright green, a Nintendo 64 with a silver cartridge metallic like silver Zelda inserted--</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Don't you want it back again?</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now following Trolley from Mister Rogers' Neighorhood along its track and then we're in the Land of Make-believe but it's after-hours again--</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">But I can never go back again, I'm tied to the Four Dreams for eternity.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now me like in a mirror with a TV camera on my shoulder, recording light on, focusing and looking happily intent. I'm anime, but the camera is "real", then the image crossfades into my rainbow-heart sign--</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>So it's all coming here.</i></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Something inside me so long frozen I'd forgotten it was movable breaks free and and <i>squeezes</i>&nbsp;and we're not in the chair anymore.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Or rather, we're not in <i>that </i>chair anymore. Boobsong is still clinging to me, and we're still cartoons, but the <i>Waifu's </i>independent-axis controls are in my hands and the sexy perfume of its cockpit fills my nose and everything is dark except indicators and the HUD because we're in flight, but outside the cockpit everything is black except the TARDIS-mode G-Diffusers and what I can see of the wings.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Game, strap us in. Location fix, Acme Station."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Tentacles gently wrap us.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Checking...how can we be <b>there</b>!?</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Earth, just inside the crust. Why is there this big cave here?"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Wait, what the fuck? That's impossible, we're not projecting, are we?"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Green checkmark, then Boobsong and me cuddling together in something like a cryopod, eyes shut--okay. Just really deep. Then what...?</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Computer, lights. What're we under, Acme Station?"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's a fuzzbeep of confirmation and beams of light flick on and light up floating bits of dust, but don't seem to reach far enough to light anything up. I spin us, watch the lines flit by on the HUD, but every direction seems the same. Of course I can turn the brightness <i>UP </i>if I have to, but that might get irreversible.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Acme station feeling...rrr...</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Upside down below the mountain we called green-top! It's really hard to feel, though, like something isn't here yet. Acme Station senses say it's in another storybraid but what can be so deep that isn't just a rock-thing?"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Can we not see because we're ghosts and our light can't reflect?"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes I'm very sure but maybe your light can shine because you're Earthling and you're magic? The Waifu's lights are just laser-pumping diode-strings."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I put a hand up to the canopy above us and beam a beam of gentle sunrise out of my palm--</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"HEY! QUIT!"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A weird annoying impolite feeling like armwrestling meets my trying to project the light past my hand, that's also like having someone talk over me <i>and </i>contradict my words. I stop, rub my hand, look up--</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Gasp that's Infernal on a lightbeam! It's really hard to read though, very spacey dialect..."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Flickering light shines from where my hand pointed, bright and every-wavelength like the Starlight I'm named for...it's not <i>family </i>that I can tell, but there's the homey sense of the voice of my own kind in it--<i>another light-being!?</i></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It disappears before I can think about answering.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Can you figure out what it's saying?"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Oh Princess it said sorry. It thinks...thought...we were Eden bad stuff. Um...Eden has a steel...what? Oh WEAPON okay...weapon um Earth destroying flash-ball it keeps on putting in here. The anti-light field stops it but Eden keeps on trying. Um...thinks it might go somewhere else? Eat...mouth...into Eden's insides."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Into Eden's--wait, we're under Green-top?"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Nod very specifically it's right where you think yes.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I can make holograms, this is no more impossible, and what I just felt...I look at the holographic crosshair in the HUD, focus on it, feel for the light with mine, and...it's hard to explain. Sing the opposite.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The crosshair vanishes, cancelled out.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Computer, max crosshair brightness."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It flickers back, dim, but I push harder and it disappears again. What am I that I can do this? If I can cancel light this way, the photons that carry electromagnetism--</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Computer, wait one to three seconds and then hide the crosshair for five seconds."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Fuzzbeep, nothing, then it's like my very weak armwrestling opponent gave up suddenly...and a tiny version of the weird darkness-explosion I saw after the box of Starlight Princess stuff followed my family through the timegate goes off in the time it takes me to notice and stop cancelling the crosshair, complete with a little flash-puff of plasma from gas molecules that lost their electrons to having electromagnetism turned off for them by my fight with the crosshair going on too long.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"This is the timegate. Acme Station quick whenwhere is it going, can you scan past the anti-light field?"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Weird wild hope surges, but it's tempered by everything from the whaleship ride--</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Checking...can feel it in the outside over Norway...um...feeling very far but can't find any starsong? There has to be something, Earth would just be ice!</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Okay we <i>are </i>short a Hitchhiker's Guide reference, it had to happen sometime...did you just find Magrathea's factory? That would explain it with my family and stuff! The timegate goes to the replacement <i>Earth</i>, which is probably in Eden's like factory or whatever--wait, are the resets just Eden <i>destroying the world? </i>I guess that makes sense with that thing in my closet. What happens then? This is really weird, why doesn't it just delete the old one and replace it? No...gah, imagine what the world would be like if it could do that actually no never imagine that cocksleeve I care about you too much. But then it can't have a factory, either...what the popsicle stick dadjokes did you find? Is the anti-light field just blocking you?"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Shake head super violent.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"It isn't in my way now. I just can't find the starsong! It's like there's nothing out there! I know it's over Norway because I feel the landscape, but there's nothing in the sky so it could be any time I can't tell."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Can you ask the whoever's guarding it to let us through? This is obviously why we're in an Arwing."</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess the gate is open. Just fly in. We came here out of nowhere, that must be why the guard thought we were bad stuff. Here I'll make you nav bars."</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Tail plug put them up right here, computer!</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A huge green circle appears on the HUD, and I pitch us up to point at the little crosshair dot in the center of it.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"We can't see anything because there's no light there, right?"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Acme Station check this yes nod.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"This should be interesting, then."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I take us slowly through, and the circle gets as big as the whole canopy, passes back around us, and we're there, I guess, but the headlights still don't find anything but dust-motes to shine on. I look for the horizon-line on the HUD, pitch us down toward it, and cold snowy winter wonderland comes into view when I pitch down far enough for the headlights to reach the ground. It just looks like Scandinavia in winter, nothing weird except the unfinished-videogame blank sky--</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Is this Limbo?"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Eyes wide check. Shake but yes it looks just like it!</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Something moving in the reflection on Boobsong's horn catches my eye. Above us, the same light-being is shining at us, but not through the portal. I flip the Waifu to face them, look into the beam, hoping I can understand a little for myself. I can't get words, but the "voice" has a kind of "average person" vibe, distant because we don't know each other and a little rough with the care of living but not mean or cold. It's nice to see one of my own species, even so. Translate, Acme Station.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Um...please watch out for icicles...no...ice...OH DEAD STUFF AAAH Perfekti!? Um...heat...our...lights up--"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">FUCK!&nbsp;"Red alert! Sensors to max!"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Lasers on open cooling vent valves ready to be Station super scary shields up!</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I crank my own light to get something better than and smile when it turns out Boobsong thought to make the canopy anti-glare: instead of just seeing my bright reflection night turns to day outside. Can they fly? I point us nose-down enough to see the ground again.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's <i>covered </i>with them. I'm surprised we didn't catch any with the headlights. I spin us in a circle to see every which way, and they're all around, out to the horizon.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Can't fly, but watch out for tall ones!?"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Eyes so wide that's scary!</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Some of them are like mountains. None seem to be noticing us, but it just gives the whole thing a really creepy awful on-the-Borg-cube vibe.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Thousands of target indicators crowd the bottom of the HUD, showing how covered the ground is.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Ask what the other light-being is doing here and if he's okay, and then why he hasn't fried these all."</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Make another tail to send the light out, pointing at them...</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">«Please say why you're here and if you need help and why you haven't fried them?»</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Um...he isn't really hard...here oh his shell is somewhere else...it's safe he says don't worry...he wants to know if yours is...and he says don't fry them you'll harm the people they're attached to."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"That's why my guardian only came for the one that had evangelist guy after Jesus got it off him. This...<i>is </i>Eden--oh, tell them yes."</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">«Yes.»<br></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Did they not say what they're here for?"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Shake no.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Weird--"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess look at that one!"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Point with tail to show you.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She points <i>up</i>, and I spin us to face one--wait.&nbsp;</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"What is that? Full scan!"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's <i>huge, </i>tall enough to be a space elevator, and it shimmers like perfekti far away, but it almost looks like a tower...</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Rrraah send out scan-beams! Really far away not on Earth...halfway to the moon, sheesh! Up and down beams scan it...</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess I can't see past its outside but I bet it's where we go here!"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Yeah. Halfway to the moon is like a light-second, right? Can you tell if we can warp closer safely?"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Nod yes.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Scan beams say the space is empty. Would you like me to engage now?"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Make it so, helm!"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm saving&nbsp;<i>engage </i>for when we're off to a party we don't know yet.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Nacelles open...warp drive online...factor one's enough here...vwooommm hehe BSHOOMP!</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Despite the situation I giggle at the totally accurate sound effects in her mind and feel a little teary to hear a real live Federation warp-drive warm up and then boom us close enough that the thing fills our view.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's...like a tower, made of symbols like perfekti but the structure seems weirdly regular, not like the Lovecraftian chaos of perfekti...</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"He says watch out here, this thing is nasty."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It doesn't seem to be doing anything yet, but there's also no way in or anything. Maybe an end? I face us toward the end and start forward...and realize how insanely long the thing is.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"If we have a clear run after another few seconds do a warp-hop to the end of it."</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Ready--eep here come defenses!"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A target indicator picks out a speck coming from the end of the tower-thing, and then doors open all over it and the sky fills with things that could be enemies out of StarFox made symbols like perfekti but clearly <i>not </i>perfekti--perfekti look insane because they're <i>madness!</i>&nbsp;These are machines...right Acme Station? I won't be hurting people, can you tell?</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Um...looking very fast..</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes PLEASE PRINCESS HURRY!"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I snatch the controller off it's spot on the arm of my throne, do a barrel roll, hammer Y, and turn half the fleet into flying symbols with my first volley. It's not the same as Venom, but I'm still the Mistress of StarFox. This just means I have to pay attention.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">But I can still make this victory really mean something.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Computer, enable Stupid Bimbo Mode."</p><p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Not available during live-hostile situations."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Aww. Worth a try. This is kind of intense...</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess I can help use me! Just tell me what to shoot at and I'll use the phasers!"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"We have phasers!? Anything that gets close!"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Raah computer fire!</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Flashes of familiar orange doom flicker around us as what I guess must be strips along the wings make pitch-perfect phaser blast noises, and the assault gets more manageable.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Light-being says keep going there's a door here big enough to fly through he...um...hears no tastes...light-feels it up ahead here!"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Make our rail-shooter rail go in when you can find it."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A biggish sort of capital-ship-thing occupies my blasting until I realize it's taking damage and is just huge and I've sent a novabomb at it before I think--</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>"Damn."</i></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's really like being at ground zero of a nuclear explosion. Light even I think is bright wipes the sky clear...and then doors open and the tower sends a whole new fleet out.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Rraaaah more phasers! Taking down the warp drive that's okay right yes see you power into--yes say computer open intakes!</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Computer open intakes!"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Good tacops, responding the instant I think it! Fuzzbeep, and all around my body light-pipes lined with Boobsong-silver unfold to take my light into the Waifu's power systems and I bump us to whatever crazy Kardashev number me having an adrenaline rush rates.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's <i>awesome. </i>Thudding-heavy StarFox-CD-style upgraded twinlasers turn into huge blinding ball-lightning fury twice the size of the Waifu that clears a path with every shot instead of just destroying what it hits, and Boobsong's phaser-blasts take on the thickness and angry deep thunder of the Enterprise's gigaphaser from the future timeline of All Good Things.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The tower opens more doors, but we keep up anyway, and now it doesn't close them.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Suddenly our course bends away from the tower--oh, because a huge capital ship has come to see us. A half-second of Secret Weapon with these blasters and the front is smoking embers and it's turning broadside. Doors open, and lasers blast out, but I barrel-roll aside and fill each lens with fire in turn. The ship starts turning to run, showing thrusters, then explodes with a brilliant flash leaving a big chunk of tail-section drifting.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Turn-arrows blink at the right of the HUD suddenly and our course bends toward the tower around the fragments of shattered warship, and we're heading for a huge door, open a crack but closing, in the side of the tower. I slam the accelerator and we just avoid the spinning warship-tail and the computer bends our course to line us up with the huge teeth that make the door's gap zig-zaggy and there's a zap of the closing door catching the shields but with this much power they charge right back up again and we're in and the door is closed behind us and there doesn't seem to be anything to shoot now. The computer stops us so we don't just fly right to the end of the hangar this seems to be, and I pant.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Alright, now that we're <i>in </i>the trap, what do we do with it?"</p><p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW"><i>Go with our love, Lucy Starlight Hardred of the Strawberry Family.</i></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreamtalk is familiar and sudden tears well up.</p><p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW"><i>You can do this!</i></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A younger voice now.</p><p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW"><i>All our family watches. Be like our namesake, tart and sweet!</i></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This one sounds old, but like she's following her own advice. I sob, because I can feel them, generations and generations, all watching, all with us. I shine them a tearstained rainbow strawberry back, and put my hands back on the independent-axis controls.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Let's rock and roll."</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Your Acme Station watches too Princess and she's finding the route for you!"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Turn-arrows flash at the lower-left of the HUD and I turn toward them, see something like a door into a dark hallway down low, carefully fly towards it. This whole place messes with my head, is weirdly hard to see like perfekti are.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Good pocket singularity. What even is this place, can you tell?"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">When we get close enough to the ground, Marathon Mode engages and we line up on it, but I keep my hands on the independent-axis controls so we'll be ready to fly in an instant if we need to.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Um...it feels like it's made of the stuff that perfekti are like how you're a light-being made of light in a human-shaped shell there's a person in here made out of something I can't say what but they have perfekti-shaped shell. I don't think it's bad I think perfekti are shell Eden breaks off because this shell is organized and like people make and perfekti are weird like just random from smashing."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"They must have thought we were another one of Eden's nightmares, too--wait, you said perfekti are prayers for one true god to exist way back in Limbo, not bits of somebody's shell."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm flying us down tunnels like we're in the approach to Andross in StarFox CD, following Boobsong's arrows when we come to a fork. All that's missing is powerups. There seems to be no resistance or anything, but the tension is mounting.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"That's how I understand them because they always say things like Praise Lord God so I said they must be from wishes for that because that's how I am you wished for a handmaiden and I say serve Princess deep down inside and I can't stop saying it because if I did I'd stop existing and if su'khora work that way maybe perfekti can't stop saying their thing and that one died when you took its Bible out so I said hah I'm right see!"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"...and their job is to hold whatever this is together in one piece, and it's not that hard to turn them into fundamentalism-monsters like you thought when you take them away from that, and fights like we just had make lots of nice wreckage for Eden to turn into perfekti. Dreams why did you let us help it like that!?"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"They're pieces of its Acme Station lost looking for their way home again!? That's horrible! Princess let's do something we have to stop Eden from making them! Why did the Dreams just let us fight them I ask too!"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Evil Kenivel?</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Oh, the Star Wars quote. What chance do stunt fighters have against that thing. We could get inside this way which I guess is worth making more perfekti--"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"That light-being is outside! He'll blast the new ones before they get people!"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Duh. Nuke and pave, whoever you are."</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"And your guardian comes as soon as they aren't on people. Maybe it can't without you here but you're here so it will now."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Okay that's a <i>start</i>&nbsp;I guess. So are you taking us like inside--wait, how does that work? I don't have light-being goo inside my human shell, right? What's this route <i>to?"</i></p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I found a place where all the pipes and stuff lead so I said let's go see that I bet we'll find out what this tower is that way."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Smart Acme Station. Why do you say there's a person here?"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Because I can smell their loneliness and wanting to kill themself."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Alright <i>that's </i>a job for us. We're coming, whoever you are."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I try to go faster, but the passages are twisty and confusing. The sense of my mothers cheering for us, urging me on, seems to surge as I strafe and swoop around corners, only not telling Boobsong to just give me a vector and full blaster power because this might be someone's body.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Why is this <i>so </i>like the end of StarFox CD?"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"So you'd be able to play StarFox to get ready for this I bet! I bet someone mused it like with you at the courtyard being the Strawberry Dynasty's ancestor because I mused out your image after."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Are we just at the center of <i>everything? </i>It makes me feel nuts."</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes for a lot but there's so much else in StarFox think of all the levels StarFox CD has! This is just the part that that muse got to and it was made to make games you would like to play a lot so it reached StarFox and Marathon and Zelda for Rada."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's a long straightaway and I zoom up it, almost miss the turn, reverse thrust and twist us sideways to take us into on passage in a wall that's just entrances to passages, swoop up the curve of the new one--</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess it's collapsing get out of here!"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's a line of light at the end of the tunnel. I line us up on it and hit the accelerator and we're thrown back into the seat there are zaps and bangs as we ricochet down the twisty hall losing shields and then shoot through the closing doorway into--</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Gaaasp wow it's <b>beautiful!</b></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Golden light swirling like smoke hangs in a ring in a huge, circular space, making it bright even without me helping. The walls as just text still, but they seem to be black where the rest was white scifi (though that was also abstraction, like I read the words and knew what the surface was).</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I stop us and turn back and forth to look at it. Is this your heart, sad person? What are you? <i>Who</i> are you?</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes it's most defintely their smell is super strong here. If we could talk to them I would say super hug you!"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Can you, Acme Station? All this is text somehow, can you see what the language is?"</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Even I think there's something sad in the way the light moves.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Maybe the light has a song in it!"&nbsp;</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Feelers so careful--aaah wait--oh!&nbsp;</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">«You don't have to hold on I'm not leaving! Thank you that's much better. Super much hugs!»</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The light doesn't seem to change how it moves in response to her--</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Dreamtalk touches me, but it's just a blank wall of gold light--no, a star, in space.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I burst into tears as it turns dark, goes as black as the void around it, and the sentence ends. Thanks to our fellow-star outside I know what it's asking and should snap back <i>of course not </i>or some such thing but instead I just cry because all the resets and that dark awful timeline with Strider are there in my soul like seams glued up now but I can remember what those moments of thinking everything I cared about never existed were and how I felt in them. I want to give comfort and say it's not so bad but I know it's the worst it can ever be.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I only survived those times because Boobsong found one way or another of staring into my eyes like she did on the stairway before I stabbed Earth out until I saw her, but if this poor soul had a Boobsong they'd be doing that already. If I can just get them to <i>see--</i></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh. This is why the Dreams only talk to me in images even though they could surely make words. That's how our kind communicate. Um...</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>Vision: the same star it just showed me, then show an undefined blank, then the star but change its color to gloomy red forlorn sadness, then the sense of a question-mark.&nbsp;</i></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">What made so you sad?</p><p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW"><i>Vision: Big blue giant star / something gets pulled down off it / tiny glass jar in the lower-right corner of a big empty view / lid put on the jar makes the light inside almost go out.</i></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>Vision: flash of indignant hypergamma / young yellow star / question-sense.</i></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That's horrible! Are you just a kid!?</p><p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW"><i>Vision: Same blue giant with a small yellow speck in front of it</i></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This is why I'm still in my kid-stuff dress. I kept thinking it <i>must </i>be time to get slutty now in the back of my head, and kept not being...</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>Vision: this tower / jar from your vision / question-sense.</i></p><p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW"><i>Vision: dotted outline of the blue-giant star missing / yellow speck shoots sideways away from anti-light explosion / jar forms around it and lid slaps on and the jar shivers</i></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Boobsong looks up at me crying as hard as I am. The corner thing was trying to say it's hiding in the corner terrified because someone killed its parent. This shell is just what a kid star can figure out how to make to hide itself. It's hard to see because it's trying not to be seen.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">And Eden's using its fear to make perfekti. YES OF COURSE EVERYTHING IT CREATES IS FULL OF THE WISH FOR THE BIG PARENT ITS WHOLE EXISTENCE LITERALLY ORBITED.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">How much of war is just the nightmares of lost kids like this grown up the way my wish for a friend grew up to become Boobsong?</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>Vision: golden friendliness / me weaving a shell of light around the jar / me standing on the nose of the Waifu to spread my arms and hug the ring of light with more golden friendly light</i></p><p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW"><i>Vision: ring-star / small pale yellow star with a box around it / [weird thing that touches entrance-to-hospital in you somehow]</i></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Acme Station--"</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I see Princess yes I'm ready just hold it with me so you comfort it."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Computer, open canopy. Game, let us free."</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's a fuzzbeep, and the canopy slides forward, and the game lets us free. Decompressing air blows us out of the cockpit--there's none in the star's heart-chamber of course--and I instinctually flumph my wings out and flap and am surprised when they seem to be able to move me anyway. Fairy magic, I guess--I flap toward the ring of light, and get Boobsong facing it beside me.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Pick it up, little one.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Reach out with my fields so carefully, gently take all its light and hold onto it...snif Princess it's so cold it should be super warm but I barely feel anything! Princess come and hold it it needs comforting!</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Sobbing because I don't know how and that feels so terrible. Boobsong has her wings up and hands stretched out and beautiful purple-sparkly fields are reaching out from her around the ring of light to hold it--</p><p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW"><i>Vision: box around schoolhouse with little star in window of schoolhouse</i></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Keep you safe and teach you--I--oh, kid--cocksleeve how do I hold it I don't know what to do.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Reach with a hand and just feel for it like with the crosshair, then say comforting support you instead of opposite cancel.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I feel out, expect it to be hard to control, but it's the most natural thing. I find it right there like a child in front of me--no you're so cold please don't go out! The light has a warmth I can feel but instincts say icy flesh when I "touch" it.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Can I feed it, Acme Station? I have enough light for universes.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">The light is your feelings for both of you. You can say comforting I'm here now but it has to feel better to shine more.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I shine a gentle touch of golden warmth at it, comforting, and some light like molten gold flows through the wisps, and I can feel its light grabbing me in return, clinging in that desperate small way a scared little kid does.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Is it supposed to be so stretched out like this? I keep thinking it should be a little ball like it showed us.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes it should be. It stretched out like this because the only shell it could make was this and this doesn't have the technology to make spherical fields to hold it in. I can and if you make me hyperintelligent I can fix this shell to not be hurting it but I think we should find a home for it not just leave it here.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Fuck that. We're stealing its mom from the past. I don't care if it can't be changed or--wait, okay. One thing at a time. Why haven't you unstretched it yet?</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Because I can't stretch it back afterward so we have to fix this shell or find a home for it. It's already so hurt I'm surprised it's still alive at all.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Check you can fix the shell and then if you can get the poor thing into a proper shape.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Hyperintelligence raaaah--easy fix! Ready kid here we go this will be much more comfortable!</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>Vision: box around little round star / little star in hospital bed with doctor Boobsong carefully holding it</i></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">If it used the schoolhouse with me hopefully it'll understand the Earthling picture of healing and care. I carefully follow its light with my holding-beams as Boobsong's fields pull the wisps into beautiful branching golden filaments and arrange them into swooping curls and compress it all from hundreds of feet of wisps into a little bright ball in Boobsong's arms the size of a grapefruit. I face her and pull her against me so she's holding it between our four breasts at the end.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Do you have it? Is it safe?</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Checking it carefully...yes Princess all of it is here and I didn't make any part get put out. It still needs a shell though, I can't keep on holding it eternally because each star has it's own kind of shell needs and my fields can be your shell if you need them to and I can hold this star a little while but it gets harmed if I keep doing it too long.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It just glows there between us, feeling a tiny bit warmer but so cold still, reminding me of crying helplessly on the floor of the whaleship. My dress looks like space around it where it nestles in my cleavage. I wish you could just be okay with your parent-star in space, little sweet star.</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I stare for a minute--</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">GAAASP What's that EEEEEYUS SEED COMING OUT TO IT!!!</p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I can't whoop in the vacuum, but try anyway, give a happy pulse of golden light, something pushes in between Boobsong and me on the left and the star is gently pulled from our holding it.</p><p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><i>Hi kid take good care of it that star needs love and good care lots!</i></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I watch the star leaving us, floating up now with something unseen holding it--</p><p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW"><i>Hi mothers! Go away, we're destroying this! Please call soon after and we'll have storytime!</i></p><p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The journey breaks--</p>
