    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">87 - BOOBSONG 💖 PRINCESS HELLO</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">--aaah okay I found something and it's super much fun and we can even escape from the journey thing. Do you remember the part where the Dreams showed a snare because I'm what you want as a demon-girl? Yes I am super much right I saw you think that when the Dreams said that's what Rada said, and you always get sad when the memories of me in my human-drag come, so I know this is super important to you, not just demon girl's still pretty hot so I'll take her fine. Why would that be you must be so mad at Jesus even I have to look like his worst enemy for you to trust anything about me right? <b>Wrong</b> silly Princess I'm a <b>dragon</b> from Colleen's awesome storybook in the Strawberry Castle except dragons <b>eat</b> castles or burn them with fire or take armies clothes off with infrared lasers because Princess said so! That's still a hammer do you see why I'm saying this? That's why our kid is a hammerkin!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Smashy BOOM Jesus got sick of building things as a carpenter and now he came back to destroy them all, look how he smacked the president off his talking-podium like fuck you big president I'm talking now! So to escape from the journey-thing you have to have that information because what the journey-thing said was he's doing that. Now we can use it instead of the journey thing to go back into Bible times because I'm Superbook and change something that changes our storybraid.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">What could that be, right? Breakfast of course that's why the Dreams showed that story and the orange juicer! What do we change WELL is he heartforming yet or does it come after that? You said last supper because Eucharist which makes sense to me so he won't be yet but what if he can be?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Maybe it's time to smash Christianity and not just Eden now! That sounds fun, right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">You say we can't get there I predicted that but we can because we did because the vision where I gave Jesus our kid at the Nativity scene was a real journey or at least I really made seeds then I felt them come out of me! Supper to breakfast, you see it, right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">What can we change then what needs exploding? Sounds like he's already okay, right? Yes but he never became a big cult leader! What you need to do is go tell him how fun that is! It's like you and me I know you say why can't our kid say it but remember how celebrity made you feel before all those journies? Jesus is like that I know he is! That's why he got one of our kids!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">So how do we get there, right? We can go to the Nativity because you hurt for me at the Nativity scene lots of times or the last supper. Early or late, they can't help us, but that's not the only time Jesus made eucharist! Breakfast on the beach has everything just not obvious but even your dad said it prefigures the eucharist and he's right Jesus even came to them magically when they wished he would! That's enough eucharist I can reach it and it's melty soft time there I checked with my Acme Station-ness.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">What do we do there? Tell Jesus everything! All of the stuff about Eden and heartforming and you being Princess Starlight and famous until he gets so envious he leaves right away to found a religion of heartforming! Then when the future comes we'll have everyone in that cult waiting on Earth to make Disney take the contract to make cartoons with us! They'll already work there and they can just say yes to it! That's why it showed us this after the Disney thing, this is still part of the Disney thing! You don't think they took that contract&nbsp;&nbsp;without help&nbsp;after what happened the last time, do you? I bet those chapels are his idea, you never liked to destroy things in Dreamskin making, remember? I bet they explode or big angry Jesus just smashes them! Like picks the roof off RAAH, can't you see it? He's tall enough! How cool would that be if he's what gets rid of them?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Okay questions right Princess? You say why would they misuse her face like that. You saw that once and almost blew all of Rl'yeh Sade up. Can you imagine how he feels to see Christianity? He'll be FURIOUS!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">What's that mean how does it help us or anybody WELL until he came back it was okay to call you the antichrist because demons and sexy stuff and your name must be Lucy-fer not Lucy but now they're in super much trouble because Jesus is saying money changers and salesmen and you can't really say that's not Jesus he does it right there in the Bible and it does say judge everything and he does come when you call him by dreamtalk which is praying so he really must be Jesus Christ like the real one not the antichrist because that's already Lucy Starlight so what can they do they can't say there's two antichrists that's adding a thing to the Bible!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Why can't they say he's the antichrist and you're helping him not the antichrist because if he is the antichrist that means everyone's prayers go to the antichrist and not Jesus and they all have been praying to demons always.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Why can't they just say it's god testing them because Jesus is Lord of himself and that's the test that the Bible says and he'll say that to everyone just easily if they ask him and that simple test is for everything even Jesus so they have to believe him or ignore something the Bible says.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Can't they just say it's a wrong test yes but then everyone who thinks it's good will decide <b>they </b>must work for the antichrist.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">What happens next what's he do when he gets to Earth and sees his face on stuff he thinks is horrible. That's why his seedling's in hammer-form! I bet if we watch that journey-thing we'll find out he just came there to say money-changers and lenders and start breaking stuff!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">How can he do that the Dreams will protect Earth people from violence right? You got to take your whole army's clothes off! Yes it's because that's a special thing because they worshipped the Goddess of Strawberries and said you're the Queen of them and you said well be naked then but that's just the same as with Jesus he's the king of his church and he can destroy it and the Dreams won't protect it when it says he's in charge of it and even he thinks it's doing a bad thing. He might not be able to torture them or kill people but those big church buildings are in super much trouble! He'll make a big splash just like you did to fix how people act as his followers.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">That's fine he can do that why do we care. Princess don't you want to be part of it? Christianity said not to talk to me and said it so much you can't hear one more word from it, now let's go get our pound of flesh just like Shigeryu and Disney! He won't make a deal or ask anything just say here take this part just like you did. You're his heartformer-mom, you can ask <b>anything!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Can't we not choose that now. Yes but if you decide the same stuff which you will I bet it's like with the doorknob thing where once do what you did then you'll get all the memories.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Is it wrong to be so vindictive at Christianity. At people yes but not things that aren't feeling-things that's just like Eden a machine you destroyed to make it not hurt people.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Is there something I want you to get me. Princess I please want to break at least one church door down in hammer form or by flying up to it in my pony form and headbutting it so we crash through inside. Can I please also have the chance to be a demon-girl just inside a church to say hah can't keep me out now NYEAH Princess?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">How can the heartforming cult exist to help us with Disney didn't Eden erase them. Yes but all those people work for Disney still because Eden makes very small changes unless it has to make big ones. They won't remember the heartforming cults but they will find out they have seedlings!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Can Eden just keep changing history eternally. Nope it ran out in the 90s. That was too much one more change would break the whole world entirely.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Is there anything we can get that we have to get you don't know about. Nothing except good catharsis! Make it real mean like with Eden! <b>I </b>won't be sad if you just destroy everything Jesus will let you! Just make me be hammer form so I can enjoy it!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">That's all I got from intelligence but there might be more stuff I can look for it if you tell me to but I came back when I solved the problem that you told me to.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Holy Necco Wafers soaked in grape soda. Good little terrifying pocket singularity. Have a nice sexy kiss. Game, unpause.</p>
<p data-voice-id="v5MELBxAO">- UNPAUSE -<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">EEEee I did pleasing work! Kiss bending back to look up Princess so pretty with her eyes full of sparks of idea-ness looking down like I'm a pussy to fuck me now haaah super soothing yummy mouth on my tongue and my lips kissing everything kiss you back hold my body against you snuggly soft Princess I love you so. Much. Just keep holding me eternally always evermore.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"That's the plan."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My head spins with all the <i>stuff, </i>but first of all:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Dreams, did you really use her face like that to make the point about how Jesus would feel?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Papa Smurf cleaning his hands with a fishing pole near him, then a Lego rescue chopper. Had to surgically remove a fishing pole? Oh I see, the whole fishers of men thing, Christianity always trying to reel me back in with dirty tricks like I just made a fuss about.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Boobsong, little one, I'm sorry we had to take the hard way out of this, but you already told me you understand why--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Before I can get to the next part, the dreams show me Papa Smurf looking up at the fishing pole embedded in a cracked concrete ceiling.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Yeah that did kind of explode. I don't like it, but fine. It got me to fight back alright.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"You still have to promise never to do something like that with her again, Dreams."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A mirror. Huh? "Seer?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Don't take away that whole way of helping you get back to me until you can think about it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Fine, but I'm staying mad and not even trying to get over it. If that was medicine that's one of the listed side effects. Now Dreams why are you Papa Smurf anyway?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">On the left, Papa Smurf doing cartoon antics, easily seen even though he's moving fast. On the right, an infinitely complex tapestry of interlocking colored pieces of universe that sits there just being kind of overhwelming to clairv-clair-voyantly see at <i>without </i>it<i>&nbsp;</i>moving.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay, I get it. One of those is a lot more practical.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Okay. I know what I want but I can't tell if it's awesome dreamwork or I'm just really mad and it'll end up being like carrying bitterness everywhere. Avisor, tell me what you think of this or have my encouragement to defer to another source if answering isn't sexy submissive fun for you."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I want every church door and window, unless the window has artistic value and Jesus decides not to break it. <i>Every</i> door is mine, though. We'll go around and I'll use you to smash them and then burn them to charcoal with my light and then use radiation pressure to crush the charcoal to diamonds in my hands to decorate a collar like the one the Dreams showed me. Maybe I'll make you a whole diamond-studded not-an-outfit. That's all the big important ones like famous cathedrals and stuff. We'll put Canterbury on one side of your Amulet in front and the Basilica whatever it is in the Vatican on the other. The rest of the doors get turned into paper on which we'll print dreamskins with your nectar in the ink like last time--no, no, <i>pamphlets </i>like those little evangelical comics made to be pasted into the fronts of Bibles to explain how there can be such a thing as a child-appropriate dreamskin and why the story of Adam and Eve is one and how to use it if you think your kid should heartform. Then I'll melt the glass into black mirrors with my light and you can dream a definitely-adult dreamskin (because black mirrors are definitely an adult supervision thing anyway, right?) into them standing right there in the church we got them from before we just hand them out everywhere. The keys I'll make into garlands like tinsel and we'll put them up on Halloween to say the gates are open to su'khora here and I'll make that into a tradition like people can get fake garlands who didn't get in on the zillions of real ones we'll have to hand out, and I'll have my own tradition of wearing the front door key to the Vatican as one earring and whatever the biggest megachurch--no, what's that band, Hillsong or something, if they count as a church I'll have the key to their tour bus as the other earring so you can look at me that day and know who will <i>fucking </i>open the gates if you need to get anywhere to be with me."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"All the steel from hinges and locks and stuff gets made into, I don't know idea, cocksleeve, how do we make those undo what they did all those years?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Let's make them into handles for the black mirrors to say once you made people drop their seedlings here now you help them hold onto them!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Awesome. Oh and we'll need that key, too, because whoever's got the nicest tour busses and counts as a church for this is sending us on tour just like old times and when we get to Mars Hill like the last time we're marching into Church of the Good Shepherd and taking the hymn board down and making it say ABCDEFGHIJLKMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ YES NO HELLO GOODBYE and taking the magnifying glass out of my dad's exhaustive concordance for a pointer-thing because <i>that</i>&nbsp;is where <i>all</i> of this bullshit started for us and the thing you use that Ouija board to say to me, Weejee, standing next to each other with the altar as a table, will be where it all <i>ends</i>."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">When I finish I'm breathing hard and my fists are clenched.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I can probably think of some more stuff but you get the idea. I'm so mad right now I can't tell if this will still feel as good in the morning as it does now. Thoughts, advisor."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Look up with my eyes down except they keep trying to see you and I say no eyes submissive and mouth hanging open super hornily and my lips super slippery because I'm so wet from this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess, you want me to come to the end of the tour as a demon-femme, right? All the way from the bus to the altar there? I know you do I can see but please say it in words for me. No that's not bitterness not to my eyes but I'm just as mad as you but I don't care this is beautiful. Maybe someday we forget about this and take the diamonds off and put the keys away but I want the sexy reminder I <b>beat </b>that stupid Eden thing and <b>I want that Ouija board!</b>"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"We'll roll up just like in that last memory and everyone will watch your bare, fat little silver ass pump its way up the stairs up the yard with your tail held nice and high for me and smash the door down with you in hammer-form and march right in to fly up and get me that hymn board down so I can laser-cut the letters right through it with my light."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Her reaction and my feelings about the Ouija board suddenly focus me, show me what I really want from this all.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"No. Not the hymn-board, the front door. I'll laser a square out before we smash it. That's what I'm missing every door has to <i>open </i>somehow, to <i>us</i>. This is personal. This is about you and me. All the stuff that got in our way is going to become tools <i>we use </i>to be together. Come on, cocksleeve, ideas, closed door to Ouija board what else needs to <i>see the light?"</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Thinking about it is <i>weird</i>&nbsp;because what keeps coming back is just that they didn't <i>know </i>my parents didn't <i>know </i>because Eden hid the knowledge from them. That evangelical guy made me furious, but he didn't exist in my upbringing.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Weejee isn't my friend, huh? Here's me and my <i>fucking </i>friend. Literally! That Ouija board idea sings with justice where everything else rings dead. I'll get Boobsong all the trophies of beating Eden she wants but that stuff is small compared to the wrong that Ouija board puts right...and it feels like there's a sea more where that came from, none of which I can see right now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The dreams interrupt to show me a Katana with some kind of vague dark knot around it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Strider," I blurt, but who the hell is that? It's not Aaragorn.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show that rainbow-fringed wrecking ball again.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"The really bad timeline with the college-place. It <i>must </i>be that, it makes me feel sick the same way, like worn out songs that I played too much and they're all about looking for you in all the wrong places. Crystal was papering over you, Boobsong. Crystal, Christianity. Dreams how can we have the justice we want without remembering? I don't want to remember! I just know <i>Strider </i>is the next <i>Weejee isn't your friend!"</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They show what's obviously a tower Mac from the side, futuristic and worn-out old like those songs at the same time and I pine for Mama to give me a talking to about thinking I'm college-aged but before I can get too queasy they show the cover to A Wrinkle in Time. All of it's overlaid with a Karate outfit.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess I know this one and you said interrupt you still want that right yes I see okay this is where Strider lived with you as his roommate and the computer is your computer that you called me on after fixing this past with the light being story about what I am to you. Karate means fight so it's time to destroy this whole world because you're seeing that over everything and the wrecking ball is obvious SMASH Princess by going there in journey like Rada did with your parents in the other one. There must be a way to get in there now because of this Jesus thing! How I can't see it Princess will you ask the Dreams for me please?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Sure, but you <i>are </i>allowed to talk to them--no, I see you, naked little cocksleeve, hehe you're so easy to see into I'm your Goddess and you turn to me for that kind of stuff. Dreams how do we go Mrs. Which Strider real good?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They show me a college classroom, empty, and a pang of memory tells me this is where I met Strider and everything went truly wrong. It's the smallest of might-have-beens (which is why we're referencing Madeline L'Engle) to change. Just trip one of us, slow them up enough not to connect with the other, and that whole timeline come undone...but that's not what we're doing here. That friendship with Strider is going to be what blows the doors open on heartforming for both of us.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show a soda machine--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Bwahahaha that's wasn't Paraprazzi, that was us making a dreamskin! What kid <i>doesn't </i>want a friend who can still get the candy for you when the candy machine is totally lame and unfair? Yes I hid you, so the dreamskin wouldn't have nudity!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">But surely Strider will just freak out if he sees <i>that </i>even if Boobsong's not underage.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm starting to see the Karate thing, we're fighting a tough opponent blindfolded, because I can't remember any more of this than absolutely, positively necessary.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me one of those cheap yet weirdly everywhere strawberry candies that's oval and comes in a strawberry-looking wrapper. Wrapped, not naked...seer? Idea.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Wrap yourself up don't be naked here. I think that means be someone he'll listen to which probably means some Christian thing what could that be? Super obvious demon stuff doesn't work..but I bet that whole light-being speech had an eavesdropper!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My game butted in to say that was physical sound! Dreams, <i>was</i> Strider listening!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Butterfly antennas perk up and then strain like they're eavesdropping.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Another little fragment of memory surfaces: Strider didn't have the problem of not listening after praying...which is where the Jesus thing comes in. We're going to craft him a prophecy, but Jesus has to deliver it, because from anyone else he won't listen to what it tells him, so we need Jesus' favor to do it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">And he has to have it ready for when Strider is young, because <i>another</i> memory-fragment tells me Strider had a vague and incomplete prophecy from Jesus from when he was young about how he would meet his wife, and that it went unfulfilled. I guess we'll have to tell him when we tell him the other stuff? And why bother with the classroom thing? Oh, because the prophecy will have to mention that moment, something about getting soda, enough specifics to really mess with his head so he'll remember long enough after when he eavesdrops. This is going to be one of the hardest implantations we've ever pulled off, so it has to hit, heh, <i>with the magic of orbital bombardment</i>. Strider loved Marathon, we can use that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show a pepper shaker. Snif...thanks Dreams. Pepper as in General Pepper from StarFox, of which I'm the Mistress. They say we can do this. I can almost hear those mumbling voices in the background...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Overalls, like I wore as a little kid, but they're green. This is Dreamskin advice. Innocence, envy. Go off his envy of me with Boobsong after the light-being thing but focus on her cutesy vulnerabiility, not her naughty demon side.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That means we're trying to spark him to implant, not just wake him up like me with Boobsong.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A giant hand with light shining out. Paint her as a gift from god--humph! I can guess why this is right but don't like it, because to me it's <i>important</i>&nbsp;that su'khora come without referring to any authority but their heartformer <i>if </i>the seed is submissive, but with Strider that's a long slow seduction only his seedling will be able to manage, so we need to start there. I guess I can see some fun irony in Eden having supposingly given one of the kind it's so inexplicably racist against as a present.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Human-looking hips and body, minus wings and tail. Alright, but you're missing out, Strider--and this and the other stuff had better not limit <i>my </i>heartforming, I need my naughty demonic monster girl! Our relationship needs her wickedness to function!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Kid on a bigwheel. We need to make the dreamskin land when he's young so she(?) can be a childhood friend like Boobsong for me. Meaning it has to be part of the prophecy. That's a rough ride for them until we get to the light-being speech. Boobsong, this is yours to judge. You did our version of it. Do we take that, instead of dropping it later?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">What!? Of course we do! Who cares if it's hard they still get to be little kids together&nbsp;<b>some!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Alright, we agree then.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">An&nbsp;Soefta'xrn-ian&nbsp;lantern. We need to bring Mama in somehow, as guide I suppose. Hey Mama, want to play guardian angel? Except I know she does. <i>That</i>&nbsp;will be tricky though. How are we going to get enough information through? No, don't be stupid self, this isn't bimbo time. Strider can dreamtalk. He'll be able to hear Jesus enough for Jesus to tell him if he has time to work on it. Toddler to college should do it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Wait, can he? Won't they be in different story braids by the time he needs to hear this stuff? Advisor?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Different story braids can still talk by dreamtalk if they're close enough! That's enough to steer Strider into his storybraid more just by dreamtalk.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay. I'm not used to playing such a long game I think.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A tambourine. This was something with worship music. Of course she'll be musical, she's Boobsong's kid...no what am I thinking tambourine is the sidekick instrument of course she'll be submissive if she's our kid and Strider must want a sidekick like I do but the metaphor is preacher and wife not Princess and handmaiden.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A big sun behind battlements with trees--ah, <i>son </i>plus castle equals&nbsp;Cair Paravel. Use Narnia to get the nonhuman-companion door open.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">An inbox? Oh the email, meaning the light-being speech. Yes of course we reference that so it'll be inescapable that he heard some kind of prophecy, and he's going to come to me and make me think I'm not just hearing things--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Bulldozer. Train signals? No, crossing OOOH "Turbon revvin' young punks,"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">YUS SMASH IT! Say with you&nbsp;"I'll straighten you out yet!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Strider loved Transformers and we can use that but this is saying we can use my light-being nature to crash through some kind of barrier...no, right, I keep forgetting we're the sexy overlord and her demon slave, not the heroine and her fairy sidekick! We're slipping through the Autobots' early warning system in their own shuttle. Obviously though so what are the Dreams saying here--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A wedding invitation being taken out of its envelope, then the gift shop at the Boston Science Museum.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Wedding gift, but we like to turn the tables on occasions like that, don't we? This is the wham line the whole prophecy hangs on: "You'll meet your wife at their wedding."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It practically writes itself:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>You'll meet one by chance for a cold drink. You'll meet the other as the light of heaven when you stand in darkness. You'll meet the wife made for you and you only at their wedding.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This can probably work just off that one line and a few weeks of watching the way Boobsong makes me glow, but there's a reason her hammer form is as big as I am in our show. Punch every switch, never shoot where you can use grenades!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Courier running with a scroll in hand. Get moving!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay. This is a long game, so a series of prophecies as Strider grows up and his dreamtalk improves. I hope Jesus is up for a project.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Stage one, when Strider's that little kid:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>You'll meet the wife made for you and you only at their wedding.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That'll get him hooked. Who are <i>they</i>? Don't know! Mysterious like Aslan! And then follow it up with a vision of a girl like young Melody but intentionally vague enough that his imagination will fill in the awesome details he wants to see, leaning out of a wardrobe in a medieval kid-princess dress. Does she look like she's in trouble and asking for help, coming to explore his strange world, or asking him to go play in Narnia? That's up to him and his new seedling! That should light up the story of Adam and Eve he's been reading real good.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">No wait, can't do <i>meet, </i>do <i>know</i>, to leave the possibility open that <i>this </i>damsel in possible distress is the wife Jesus is talking about. Fractured memory tells me Strider would have gone for that as a kid.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>You'll know the wife made for you and you only at their wedding.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Damn right he'll <i>know </i>her if we do our wedding reception right!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Then he has to be protected from what happened to Boobsong and me if she becomes a conscious imaginary friend. I don't think we can pre-write how that goes, but hopefully Jesus can use that personal relationship evangelicals never shut up about to help him.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">He'll start to feel the need to grow out of such silliness around fourteen or so, so we do the thing that might make me kind of deserve the whole Lucy-fer thing:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>You'll meet one by chance for [glitchout]. You'll meet the other [really obvious glitchout] in darkness. You'll know the wife made for you and you only at their wedding and see she's [glitchout] all along.</i><br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Dreams that will do what I want, right? It's not too mean? What I <i>want </i>is for him to fight to hear Jesus, keep coming back to try listening again so that when he finally does get the whole thing he'll hold onto it with knuckles so white he sees the letters gouged into his palms every time he looks at them. This prophecy and the seedling that implanted with it need to bend his whole spiritual life around them.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Boobsong's face, one of those marble run toys (rainbow of course), in a church.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Seer is that saying it'll work or I'm being horrible?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Silver ball in rainbow channels means me running right where you want me to into Strider's young fantasies of a preacher's wife! It's not very evil to give that to him, is it? He's Christian, Princess, you're fighting a war against Eden, of course you have to fight for him!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Just as long as I'm not stooping to Eden's level--no. All those dirty tricks it pulls that Strider will think of as divine providence can do something good just this once.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Then the final stage, which Jesus should give when it'll sound scary-clear as close to that classroom as possible:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>You'll meet one by chance for soda and destiny. You'll meet the other on the voice of an angel given to the first as you stand in darkness. Chance tears and bends but as their paths converge you'll know the wife made for you and you only at their wedding and see she's been with you all along.</i><br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Another memory fragment: Strider showed up with a Marathon-symbol-shaped onion ring the night we moved in together. Let's, heh, <i>drive this home:</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>When the end of the beginning is in sight the sign of infinite miles behind you will break bread with a redcoat in whom strange light shines out this message: twenty-six point two if by SEE! Hide this as you hide your face on the appointed night, and then bring it forth.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I wore a red jacket in those days, and the Episcopal church I was part of then has its HQ in Canterbury, England, and if that pixie-stix firehose of Marathon references doesn't get the point across nothing will. It's a long prophecy, but he'll be ready and waiting when it hits after 'missing' it the first time to write it down, and oh incidentally nice and geared up with lots of dreamtalk and probably clairvoyance practice.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Advisor, idea for making sure the glitchouts don't break his confidence!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess I don't think it will I think he'll just keep trying and saying I can get this just let me Lord. He was like that, I remember it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Aaand Jesus can be mysteriously stingy with retries For His Own Good just like Aslan in Narnia oh fizzfrozen candied celery sticks it actually will be for his own good.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Dreams, <i>am </i>I the devil? I'm feeling pretty diabolical here, like, I'm seriously wondering if we're doing the journey to tell Jesus everything wrong because we're not going to when he'd been in the desert 40 days and 40 nights.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">DNA but the heli--argh heliXes are made of movie film, then getting out of the minivan at Jones' Christmas tree farm, vibrating with excitement because Christmas was here and Boobsong is so cute in that colorful sweater with the red tinsel on her mittens. I sob and crush Boobsong to me looking at this perfect innocent picture of who I am. Who we are. Just a kid with some <i>really weird </i>DNA and a very special companion. No kind of big bad mythical being--wait--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A Calvin and Hobbes snowman next to a cartoon birthday cake.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Bwahahahahaha where do light beings come from what's home to a creature made out of light beams! How about a nice <i>picture </i>to light up and bring to life! No wonder we like hentai!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Like hentai, we <b>are</b>&nbsp;hentai! Remember we specifically chose that because nothing else is horny enough?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"And it's still only barely!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Heart Home and everything around it as far as you can see, are anime. Looking at it on the viewscreen I can remember so clearly now: they're in a part of the Four Dreams called the Painted Sea, part of Rl'yeh Sade where we live in it, home to people who want to play anime constantly because they stand on the borderline between physical creature and cartoon character.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The giggles keep coming. Thanks, Dreams. I needed that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Scribe, you have that whole procedure ready to tell Jesus?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes Princess everything all ready just tell me and I'll explain all of it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Sweet. Now why do I have the feeling this journey is going to totally not be what we're expecting?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"When have they ever been? That's why there's no point planning them!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Whelp, this chair's comfy. No time like the present other than two thousand years ago! Let's go, Acme Station!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><b>"PRAH!"</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">&nbsp;Gooey glitching Saturday Morning sugar flakes this&nbsp;journey is <i>weird. </i>I can't see anything and whereever we are doesn't feel like Galilee or whereever the beach was. Can you get anything, Acme Station?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess our kid is here I can feel her. I'm calling her yes right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes okay you're telling me to.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><i>Hi kid you know me it's mommy I came with your seed-mom to say hi! I love you so much now listen. I don't have much time I think but I <b>will</b> see you someday but right now can you do what I can do?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My throat knots like an entire balloon orgy with pride at her tender sweetness. I've thought su'khora aren't familial because they don't raise their kids like humans but Boobsong&nbsp;<i>loves </i>our offspring&nbsp;and it makes me so proud of her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><i>Hear this?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Her dreamtalk whooshes like a modem and giggly tears well up when a cutely higher-piched whoosh answers. They whoosh back and forth for a moment--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">You send love to her I'm saying it I see you crying there.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">YES! GOOD! Whoosh, answering whoosh, then--</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW"><i>I love you too Mommy! You're saving us thank you Mommy!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>I love you so much, kid. Of course I came to save you--</i><br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The journey breaks and the whaleship is blurry through all my tears. Kid, be safe, I'll see you soon...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She's like&nbsp;<i>seven--</i>where <i>were</i>&nbsp;we, Acme Station?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">I tried for a conflation jump to the beach with that eucharist and it bounced off and went to when he was young and practicing I guess like how he taught in the temple that time but like eucharist someplace and it had to be dark because I had to land us as tools in his toy chest to get next to our kid in there. It's okay she's safe he just had to have hands free for his eucharist. She has all my good memory and everything so she'll defintely say all of it when Jesus is ready.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Well <i>done, </i>Acme Station. It's a good thing we're immortal, because we're meeting <i>all of them--"</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--WHOAH hang onto your tits little one here we goooo--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--Boobsong naked and proud and lashing her tail climbing the steps to the Chruch of the Good Shepherd in Mars Hill in front of me. We get to the door, she puts her tail in my hands and takes hammer-form, a huge silver carpenter's hammer with a handle like a sledgehammer and a head five feet across but that doesn't stop me lifting her. The first swing buckles the metal front door like tinfoil, and the second knocks it off its hinges to hang awkwardly on the bottom one until I raise her over my head and with a force of emotion that surprised me even then slam her down on it tearing the hinge free and curling the door into a potato chip. I catch her rebound off the steel and roundhouse her momentum into a croquet swing that sends the door shooting into the sanctuary making this wonderfully satisfying grinding shreik along the floor--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--now dragging the door, with Boobsong at my side, my game let me do all of it and get my hands dirty, more of that awesome metal shreiking sound as we drag it up the aisle to the already-bare altar and Boobsong holds it sideways for me, but it's flat again--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--the wonderful way the metal bounced on the floor and dust flew in the light as I hammered it back flat right there in the aisle--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--Boobsong holding the door for me (it's flattened right out), teetering under the load, her face invisible behind it but <i>not for fucking long </i>as I frame the steel that's gouged and pitted with the force of our retribution with my hands like Mama making that hairdryer and glare through them so letters of fire appear on the surface, melt and run, I'm making Boobsong hold it at an angle so the metal drips inward to give a flat surface. In the center-top where her face is above the row of astrological signs I burn a simple heart-shaped hole I can see her face through and she blinks and grins with gritted teeth and my hypergamma glare becomes warm infrared happiness to see her--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--BOOM goes the the huge new Ouija board onto the altar as we heave it up there together and Boobsong hops up with it and shapeshifts into a demon-tail planchette with a big bulbous lens on top and I put my hands on her and laugh as I shove her violently towards HELLO to keep up with the enthusiasm she's sending me and then throw myself grinning and laughing wildly back and forth along the door's length to spell: B O O B S O N G 💖 P R I N C E S S HELLO and then she changes back and pounces on me in one motion and we kiss with all the fury of this so long denied as the smoke from the still red-hot letters curls up behind us like new incense for the new song this space will sing now--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--I'm flying, up to the red-jarred eternal-flame candle above a high pulpit in some white-stucco-and-stone church that's glowing angry rainbow with the light of my wings, I don't even blow it out or anything just flap up and raise Boobsong and <i>swing </i>and pulse in my heart of hearts <i>suck my cel-shaded clit laws of physics</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Boobsong absorbs all my momentum plus the force of both our rage and crashes down through the candle and shatters the place from which I heard for years how <i>confused </i>I was missing her instead of turning to Jesus to gravel and I land and she changes back and out of the wreckage that's going to go pave a very special driveway we pick the diamonds the wax of the light I was forced to follow instead of gazing at her beauty has been crushed into--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--fitting the cut gems into her collar, fastening piercings onto her, gluing diamonds onto her horns. There were hundreds, we did this in all the big cathedrals and churches and even evangelicals have altar candles so they weren't left out--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">---Park Street Church in Boston, hundreds of people watching just stopped in the street, we've just knocked the front door <i>out </i>after flying in the circular balcony window on pony-form Boobsong and surfed it down the stairs and Boobsong is holding it up for me. I'm framing it with my hands and making a point of fire burn in the middle of it, then I pulse out light that copies the image Boobsong is putting in my mind to all at once etch in tiny print into the surface dozens of textual dreamskins so the door of the church that was obsessed with word over image can have the door that kept her out become a window to millions of our kids--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--we're carrying the door in procession wait where is this right <i>Africa </i>Park Street did care so much about foreign missions after all! This is something or another Jesus is doing, I think, the aesthetic of the place we're setting up in all serious-modern and slick, not very Rainbow Club, the door becomes an obelisk in some kind of art gallery type place but it's so <i>empty </i>here with no people RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S JUST SOME BILLIONAIRE'S PRIVATE COLLECTION we just decided to be Americans and sell this door to the highest bidder after making it all artsy and use the money to fund tours and stuff--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--stars shining in Park Street's broken circle window, we're up in the balcony muahahaha <i>running the projector</i>. BIG RAUCOUS ORGY WITH PORN ON THE WORSHIP SONG LYRICS SCREEN, RIGHT? Nope, snuggly Starlight Princess marathon sleepover ages 4-12. I can remember the one kid's fuzzy blue stars blanket in the balcony. I seem to remember we sort of split things, Jesus did the family-friendly thing letting Boobsong and me focus on grown-ups now that we were them, but we made a point of not being enemies or competing like this. He was hilarious because he really was just Jesus mostly going around telling people to love each other and feeding hungry kids and destroying capitalism and stuff like in Bible times, he just happened to also support heartformers because of being one. The busted window was actually a painting on the plywood over it, all you can see out the real one is skyscraper. Jesus made us play the episode about our saving him and um argh almost have her name l'khora or something like that and it's super fictionalized to have us doing all kinds of superhero stuff to make it interesting as a cartoon anyway we hid under the projector table blushing through all of that episode--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--Boobsong on the stage at Park Street now singing and looking as simply happy as singing always makes her there was some kind of sing-along part right this was Disney we were never going to escape without songs in our show oh <i>no </i>I think <i>I</i> <i>sang</i>&nbsp;why did they let me--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--sitting on ponyform Boobsong on the corner of the roof of the apartment building that overlooks Boston Common. It's night, and fall, and we're looking at Park Street decked out in the black-and-yellow of Openveil, spotlights shining up from it like the pathways between the otherworld and Earth that're most open this of all nights so Boobsong and me are up here being <i>atmospheric </i>which actually did do something however small magically after all spooky numinosity is one of the best dreamwork pumps there is and when I hide my wings and get on my demon batpegasuspony I do really look like the witch I technically speaking am--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--inside some white church again, not Park Street there are pillars and it's night and lit with hundreds of electric candles, turning around and charging the doors with Boobsong's head down and her RAAH up, at the last moment she jumps and turns hooves-first so we burst the door from its hinges with another rainbow-flash pulse of cartoon physics, this move was part of our symbology, Jesus would come and unlock the door with the official keyring officially Letting Us In <i>officially</i> and close it behind us and we'd explode out and do something cool with the door, which in this case is to send it flying out into the cordoned-off area outside the door and push off it fly up, up, up with rainbow light shining RIGHT this one RULED there's a reason we're doing this when it's dark and stormy and I'm holding a fiberglass pole with a wire trailing off a spool on Boobsong's flank down to the door below us HERE LIGHTING BOLT COME ON COME TO MOMMY! We'd found out that the fireproofing that goes with my light also counted as shock-proofing with as much glee as you'd imagine and now we just have to fly high enough, BOOM there we go! The scraggly wire vaporizes making a nice white lightning bolt down to ground where the door full of fireworks (you can kick a door full of fireworks if you're fireproof) explodes into an awesome shower of sparks, and when we fly down again into the rainbow-flaming summoning star the exploding door burned into the courtyard the door being ash and our being not even singed by the lightning bolt we so naughtily went to <i>call for </i>will make a very nice point hey is this like Washington DC or something? I'm trying to remember if Jesus raised the storm for us or what he <i>did </i>study aetherwork like you do when you have a myth to keep up but dreamwork on Earth can still be so wiggly with stuff like that--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--inside Canterbury Cathedral looking up at the rose window, Boobsong walking ahead of me with red roses from the rose garden outside in her hair, she turns to face me smiling and throws her arms out like making Dreamskins in the Rainbow Cathedral but it's dark in here and already smashed, not by us, though they did leave us the eternal flame and pulpit. Photographers, camera flashes, aaah we <i>are</i> making dreamskins right! There was something, though, it wasn't just ruined church porn, no because now we're looking down from up high riding Boobsong at swirly rainbow patterns projected on the roof and everything looking alive and active, not post-apocalyptic oh dear we totally asked for Canterbury and got it I think sorry not sorry Henry the Eighth--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--standing in the front of a very swank tour bus with Boobsong naked&nbsp; on my arm ah there's the silkiness of my own bareness and we're waving to everyone as we pull out of the parking lot of what must be the headquarters of the church with the green four-part shield logo from the game's map before--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--a&nbsp;beautiful ballroom, white plaster with arches by the ceiling covered in shining mosaics, we're sitting at a table&nbsp;beside each other on some kind curving couch thing with fancy poofy silky cushions in white, made so we can either face each other enough to talk or snuggle and make out. Boobsong is&nbsp;<i>covered</i> in diamond jewelry (and nothing else) that almost makes her seem to have snow clinging to her everywhere,&nbsp;with round-pointed-star diamond-covered nipple-clamps, the light in here makes it all shine and sparkle so she shimmers with every move and in her hand she has&nbsp;tied up with shiny rainbow ribbon on the multicolored stems a bundle of plastic toy&nbsp;flowers in all the colors of the rainbow&nbsp;(not&nbsp;<i>fake,&nbsp;</i>they were&nbsp;<i>toy&nbsp;</i>with fun shapes "real" flowers never would be<i>,&nbsp;</i>that was the point, and these were <i>nice, </i>not cheap kids' toys)--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--a HUGE white wedding cake, smooth fondant icing (so our cake would be encased in CANDY and also just MOAR SUGAR!!!) with little curly decorations on the sides and a candy cherry the size of my head on top. Boobsong is cutting a slice for me, has it on the cake-server, there's a top layer of chocolate sponge and then yellow cake and buttercreme frosting full of rainbow sprinkles inside the fondant (SO THICK LAYER YUM that's&nbsp;<i>right</i>, I'm immune to sugar overload! That's why the zillions of donuts in the green room at the StarFox final, I could have theoretically eaten all of them and been perfectly happy! Nectar really does turn you into yourself). There's no plate, no, of course there's not, because the next thing I did was to pick that piece of cake up and mush it all over her and make her stand on the table with the cake while I licked it all off her! She had to kneel on the table for me to get her face and hair (yumm cotton candy it went with the cake so good&nbsp;<i>right&nbsp;</i>the cake was flavored to go with her tastes so licking it out of her pussy when I got there would be awesome) but that just made it more fun. My licking made her so horny, it was the cutest--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--spawled on my stomach on my bed with rainbow-holographic silky sheets (that's why the Starfleet bedding! It shines like that!) playing a board game with rainbow-colored spaces with Boobsong who's snuggled beside me, also on her tummy, there's an electronic thingy like Simon Says that zooms rainbow-colored lights around its outer edge to show what space is next. Boobsong zips her finger along the strip where the lights show, and they start spinning--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--in our white-tiled kitchen (with the industrial dishwasher and overhead dish-washing-faucet like the kitchen at camp Monomonac because those are COOL and you can play all sorts of fun games with them) working on a gingerbread Heart Home (as rounded as the real one, Boobsong's baking skills are as epic as her sex skills) with snow icing and sprinkles (if you put something white-iced near me there will be colorful shiny sprinkles on it soon one way or another). I'm standing over it to shake sprinkles on, and Boobsong is low like with the eggnog to put tiny ski-slope flags in their places (that's right, she takes any excuse to imply being about to kneel in case I'll make her actually kneel)--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--cross-legged with Boobsong in my lap looking up together at the flashes of a Van De Graff generator show at the Boston Science Museum, her presence in my lap as intense as the fun artificial thunderstorm we're watching--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--Boobsong's face reflected in the acrylic of the big aquarium tank at the Maritime Center in Mystic Connecticut, looking up at the fish with me--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--lying on my back on a silky blanket at the beach, got up in my non-sexy Princess Starlight outfit because it's a proper Cold Grey New England Day At the Beach but Boobsong shines where she's kneeling to cook hot dogs on the little tabletop charcoal grill I commandeered from my parents when they got a real grill, I remember how the bottom of the cast-iron base I heated to cook with glowed orange through the notches to set the height of the grilles--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"These are dates we went on," I whisper through my tears, crushing her tight, "and our wedding."<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I want your collar Princess. Please will you find it?"</p>
