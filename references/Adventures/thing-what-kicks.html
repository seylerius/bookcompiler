<article class="chapter 75---thing-what-kicks">
    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">75 - Thing What Kicks</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i><b><u></u></b></i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Nothing seems to happen at first. Then, suddenly, the cock pulls away from my mind, and eerie silence seems to fill my head, and the Dreams show me a big technic turntable, Lyra's face, and a crank.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Lyra turned the tables? Did you that you know of, cocksleeve?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy I said Dreams please protect Mommy I'm scared for her! Mommy listen why are you being so mad at this my game is made to keep you close to me the Dreams showed a vision of it giving me to you and then they said you were firing me don't you want to know what they mean by that? I don't want to be fired Mommy I'm your cocksleeve you know I need you to do anything! Mommy what's wrong with you come back to me!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"THE GAME IS WHAT'S SENDING ME AWAY! You know what's wrong you can see me perfectly well and you're wiser than most people I know I have this one tiny thread I hang by now that I can have some control over the hell I have to go through when we're not hiding out in our room together and it's trying to take even that away now! I can deal with an order for Mama's sake because I love her but I don't <i>need </i>you wheeled up to me you're right here and sure don't plan on doing anything but milking your useful sweet little ass for everything it's worth right now so it can't possibly have any motivation but knocking off this throne I'm sitting on! Oh fuck Mama--hang on cocksleeve!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I pluck us off the ground with a nudge of up-throttle, swing yaw to face the forcefield quickly, and jam the throttle forward to get the fuck out before my game calls Mama and Isht Visht down to "save" me for not being a good girl.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Can this thing take accelerator underwater, cocksleeve?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes Mommy be careful though the shockwaves will tell everyone we're leaving.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I can't plan to run away indefinitely but this seems to be possible as long as I'm just getting enough breathing room to process this and get back to the show soon. We'll see how long <i>soon</i> can be or if the Dreams will spike that order eventually or what. All I know right now is DON'T BE HERE.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Do we have a cloaking device? Can we phase like the Pegasus? I can see I'm making you sad. I'm sorry.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy please yes and yes to both of them--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Activate them. I bend left, away from anywhere we've been, as we leave the hangar. The city below is achingly beautiful but I don't have the heart to go down there right now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes Mommy. Console beep tap...now look up at you grab you leg and hold on please Mommy see me if you can't see my game see me!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">You're the only thing I <i>can</i> see. None of the rest makes sense to me. Why was that spiking necessary? Why would my game just keep pushing beyond what I could take like that? Don't say I can so take it, I'm totally proving otherwise at the moment and we both know it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">I think it was telling you something--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Actually wait, should I have even been able to resist it as much as I did? I couldn't with the thing with Guinan.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">No Mommy it's defintely able to make you take orders without being able to stop it. I think that's a message Mommy! I think it's saying it can see you can't take it's taking control away so it waited until you said yes to it to fuck you except you never said yes or even acknowledged it you just wished the Dreams to get rid of it. Of course it would keep pushing until you acknowledged its message, it must be super important if the Dreams say that you're firing me!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">It's not, though, because if there's any one thing I'm doing it's definetely not firing you! Do you feel fired? This is one of its fucking power plays, period, end stop.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">That said, a<i>m</i> I rejecting you in some way or missing a power or just going too long without fucking you because one fucking thing after another keeps freaking me out? No sparing my feelings this is serious.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy you're in pain and I'm scared because I think it's serious I think you're going to keep going until you destroy yourself. That would be firing me because you can't be with me if you're nowhere.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">If there's one thing that's been made clear to me it's that I have no way out of this especially not by killing myself. I tried it for real with Guinan, you saw. I'm in a dark place right now but I couldn't kill myself if I wanted to. I <i>thought</i>&nbsp;I had clawed back some shred of hope about coping with it but the game decided it should take that away too so now I have you and this Arwing and however long I can stretch my belief that I'm just getting some breathing room to get back to that I my game promised Mama.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I need to figure this out somehow, but I'm lost. Idea, cocksleeve--but nothing that includes hearing anything my game says to me directly or indirectly.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">It's not that it's making you commit suicide Mommy I mean that it's so bad it's making you not live or be there for me!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">We're just flying in a straight line through endless water. No one is around that I can see, and there's nothing in the way, which is good, because I can't think about much more than that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">How can I be <i>anywhere</i> for you in this? You remember Stamford! I <i>just </i>started to see a way out of that if I could just stay on top of things and do stuff on my terms but now I don't even have that. You're damn right I don't want to live if that's my life, but you're forgetting I'm still really looking forward to our alone time--which this could <i>be </i>if I didn't have that order to get back up there and give whatever show the game is assigning me to carry out for it. You can react to what I say but I want that idea this time.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy please just listen for five seconds. It's not going to be like your parents house. It just isn't like it. You have to believe in that Mommy you've seen so much stuff why is it this that's too hard for you?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I don't think it <i>is </i>this that's too hard for me. I think it's everything. It just got too much to believe in. That thing at the castle was already more than I could deal with, now having this follow on it and knowing it's my own damn fame I created to ruin paradise for me just...right now my take is this is hell after all. You don't think so because that's part of the punishment. On top of being assigned the most horrible existence I could possibly get while yet having it look <i>great </i>until I get there, I get to fall in love with you and then fail you completely because you are the one and only thing about this I can seem to believe is real or true and I think you really do love me and belive in me and all this and really are good and exactly what you say you are the problem is nothing else is. This is my punishment for my narcissism or something and so watching you pay for it because I couldn't play the part I was given is like part of the poetic justice or something.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">How can you say this stuff Mommy wake up this isn't like you Mommy come back to me please!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Her expression is so plaintive. Get in my lap, cocksleeve. Maybe up here you can warm my heart some.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Poing up snuggle close look at you so intense Mommy wake UP.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Her snuggly soft nipply warmth in my lap does help. I can manage curiosity. Why do you think my game set me off like this? I was on a knife edge in there, if it had just let me be with the one order I would have gone through with my comeback and we'd be back inside by now probably. Surely it can play me to avoid that?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Dreams I wish for a nice little hole somehwere deep and obscure with space to park this Arwing and fun toys to play with Lyra with to live in until I can get this sorted out and get back to my comeback or whatever assignment I'm supposed to complete here when I get my head right.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">They show the bench we made and I burst into tears.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I FUCKING KNOW! YES THAT IS THE HOME I WANT WITH MAMA AND ISHT VISHT AND THE COOL STUFF LYRA MADE BUT I CAN'T HAVE IT NOW CAN I THAT'S ALL FOR THE GAME'S PUPPET OR SERVANT OR WHATEVER I'M SUPPOSED TO BE!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cocksleeve I still want you to answer.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Maybe it was better because you weren't okay actually Mommy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Have you <i>ever</i>&nbsp;seen me <i>okay?&nbsp;</i>I was coping. I had a way to get through. Why would it take that from me? Was it not going to work or something?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The Dreams show me an air raid siren.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cocksleeve who's coming!? Sensors, whatever we have! Did you give us anything to see through cloaking devices? Can you look for stuff psychically somehow?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I twist around, looking for the interloper we're being warned of, but nothing is visible.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Looking on sensor screen...nothing around...the sensors have scrying in them so it's already seeking things psychically but I don't think it's somebody coming Mommy I think it's because you're not okay and they're telling you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"WELL THEN WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO, DREAMS!? YOU WON'T GIVE US A NEW HOME, YOU LET THE GAME FUCK UP MY COPING STRATEGY, I CAN'T GET OUT OF THIS ARWING WITHOUT BEING MOBBED BY VULTURES, AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THE ONLY THING LEFT IS FLY UNTIL WE RUN OUT OF ANTIMATTER AND THEN JUST DRIFT WHEREEVER THAT LEAVES US! IS THAT WHAT YOU FUCKING WANT? I GUESS WE'LL BE TOGETHER FOREVER WITH NOT MUCH TO DO BUT FUCK BUT IS THAT REALLY WHAT THIS COMES DOWN TO? IF I'M SO NOT OKAY <b>HELP ME!</b>"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">They show me a stack of brassy movie reels with a bone through their axle-holes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The Bones...they make the Four Dreams into good porn. My own happiness in that is irrelevant as long as I look good for the viewers. All that stuff in the Five Pointed Star is just recruitment propaganda.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Their response is just Lyra, a simple realistic picture of her. Do you understand this cocksleeve?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy I think it says listen to me. I don't see what you said in those movie reels. I think it's a pun like Luke Skywalker from ziplocs I think it says the Bones are reel Mommy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">This is confusing enough to pull me out of the haze of damnation I'm in. I don't doubt their reality!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Why would they tell me they're real? I don't think their not being is the problem. I believe enough to keep wishing for stuff they won't give me because they know I want the home we have to leave now."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">That isn't real enough to think they can't make celebreity good, Mommy. They're saying you have to believe in them enough to see goodness in what's happening with Rarity and everything else like that. Not just cope with it, see goodness. That's the difference Mommy can you see why it's not the same thing as just coping with them?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">What goodness could there possibly be in being harassed and picked at and criticized and and having every single person you see demand to make smalltalk and being beholden to some stupid fucked up legacy that was only ever supposed to make sure Mama got her porn and not turn me into anything at all--cocksleeve am I being really stupid here? Won't there be millions of Strawberry Princesses? Cosplayers and beings like Guinan and su'khora who just look like her because they grew up reading her stuff and <i>didn't </i>decide to be pirates? Aren't I just another wannabe as far as the world's concerned? I made that stupid prophecy, but all I have to do is not fulfill it to make it go away.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">It's not going to be like that Mommy why can't you hear me saying that? I don't think there will be Guinans because the religion specifically says there's a real Strawberry Goddess I remember it in the books you read to me as a teenager in Stamford I see you it's not here for you but I can remember it the real Strawberry Princess will come back one day so just wait don't make idols or try to replace her with priestesses like her be yourself and have fun the way you are. That's why Isht Visht's a water sprite, she's mischevious yes and Rada's a pirate but it would be this horrible sacrilege if she looked like you and it would make Rada feel super bad just to look at her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">This brings me up short. A weird, cold hope dares to rise like an early Johnny Jump-up from a snowbank.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cocksleeve, I do hear you, I'm trying to be kind. You're a wise cocksleeve but you can be pretty naiive and if you think there's any other way for celebrity to be you're being naiive.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">We don't have time to worry about that though, because if what you just said is true, I <i>can't </i>come back. To Mama yes and meet her family and everything but if what you said is true the Strawberry Princess returning will spoil the whole party. Right now the whole thing is a house of cards propped up on the idea of amusing yourself while I'm gone. The minute I come back all of that vanishes, poof, party ends, because the image I created at the castle becomes the black hole everyone's independent fun gets sucked into and annihilated. Do you--wait--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Sweet loyal royal advisor, why don't I have the memories? I couldn't believe I could walk in heels because I don't <i>remember</i>&nbsp;anything. The most I have from our wedding is a square party tent outside at the camp and that's honestly just me guessing it doesn't even seem like us. Do you have any idea? Answer everything I'm just loading your strong mind up.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Okay Mommy first I'm not very wise I agree with that so I'll listen if you say I'm stupid but there are other ways of celebrity that's what Rada was telling you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Second why would you coming back destroy everything? Wouldn't they just have even more parties to celebrate?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Third Mommy I think it's your story-braid you're stuck in one where the Four Dreams can't make celebrity good. That has to be causing something because you can't believe the Four Dreams enough for them to help you get memories like they can't even touch you in this place you have to believe they can make anything good. It's just like how feudal societies can't see them except what you can't see is their making celebrity good.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Well I think I'm stuck then because no I can never see celbrity as a good thing for me. People can like it if they want but that can't change the fundamental nature of the thing or make it something I'll like.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">...and that's the point of me. Okay, I know what we're doing cocksleeve.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Computer, chart a return course to the hangar."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I know that's your job cocksleeve but you have a more important one right now which is keeping my heart warm enough to move at all. Snuggle like our life depends on it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Waypoints appear behind us at the edge of the HUD, and I swing us around to face them and set give us a burst of throttle.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Game, Dreams, I need to cancel it out perfectly. I think I know how but please help me do that anyway. You too cocksleeve if you have ideas.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The Dreams show me a nuclear warhead, and then a cigar like the seargant from Aliens smoked: dust off and nuke the site from orbit, it's the only way to be sure. Which, one notes, would have saved the lives of the entire team and the survivor they found if they'd done it--oooh.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Don't</i>&nbsp;try to save the stuff. Trying to protect the terraforming station because it was costly was the evil act that got everyone killed in aliens. Just nuke everything.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Even stories and art aren't more sacred than lives. I've created a monster that's devoured countless lives--just look what it got Mama into--and is now coming for me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Can you get us back to the castle, cocksleeve? I need to fix this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The Dreams show me the view through the worldgate I remembered as we climbed down into Earth when I was tiny.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">So it was my tantrum in the sky that drove us through the worldgate and condemned Lyra and I to the lifetime of hell we had on Earth and our battles with Eden, but if I fix creating the Strawberry Nightmare all of this will unravel. Cocksleeve, I'm so sorry. I really fucked this up bad. I told you to yell at somebody in the castle but we didn't know the person you were yelling at was me. I know you won't, but you should hate my guts.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Just one more way I fucked this all up. If I could make it up to you...maybe I can do <i>something.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Here's what I can beleive in. I can believe there's a way for Lyra to be with me here now without my creating something just as bad as Eden to do it and then having to spend eternity as that monster's face in place of living my own life. Tell me how that's real, Dreams, because I know you can make it real.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">It's not something I feel, but...I can decide to beleive it, like she's been begging me to do with celebrity. She's too good for this not to be possible.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">What do I do, Dreams.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">My hair in curlers like before the castle adventure. Yes, that's the problem I'm trying to fix, how do I fix it?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The Enterprise-D, or possibly Isht Visht in Galaxy-class form.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cocksleeve do you have any idea what that means?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy I'm scared for you. I think you can't take this I think Isht Visht as Galaxy class just says you need them to save you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">How could they possibly do that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">They could take care of you and make you feel better by being strong for you. Mommy you're dying it tastes like please listen I need you Mommy please at least call Rada to come for us!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Bitter tears well up over my anger.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Cocksleeve, I love those two so much, but if we go back there, there will be some new sudden journey or prophecy thing or random occurance and I'll end up making some new horrible mistake and getting myself trapped even deeper in this sick fucked up web. The only peace I can rely on is you, loyal handmaiden. I don't need them being strong for me if that means getting piled ever deeper into craziness I can't handle. I'm sure they mean well but it's obvious that for whatever reason they just can't control the constant eruption of insanity that is their existence. I need what's safe and predictable and that's <i>you </i>you said it yourself and it's obvious enough by now you're the <i>only </i>thing like that in all the Four Dreams for me. If we find out it's <i>me </i>that's the problem, fine, let's go back, but I can't be around all that madness one moment longer. Yes I am dying. I need to get out of this fucking Strawberry Princess trap before it kills me. Emergency manuevers, get me out of that if you're scared for me. What does your handmaiden disguise power do, is it illusion or does it transform my body or what?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">She won't have any space to implore me to believe or anything now. We're fixing the problem before I die of it. Surely we can agree on that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"The handmaiden disguise turns me into a book that's of words that say what my thoughts are and you make me think by turning my pages, and I make an illusion to make it seem like you're a handmaiden."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Okay. Maybe. Is it possible that your nectar would just make me look <i>different</i>&nbsp;if I get horrified enough by the idea of being the Strawberry Princess--or would that have already happened if it was going to?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Mommy I like the Strawberry you please don't take that away from me if you can't believe it's a good thing can't you please see it how I see it? Nectar can change you if you wish it can help sometimes it knows what you're wishing not just who you are on the inside."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I wrap her tight and weep into her hair between her horns. This is the shape I would pick if I could just pick one. I <i>like</i>&nbsp;the crown and shoes. I just can't face the life that goes with them.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"What are we going to do, cocksleeve, what--why won't the Dreams give me clear answers right now? Do you have any idea? They've been all weird and vauge and that last thing was actually passive-aggressive like they didn't want to answer me but wouldn't say no either. Do you have ANY idea what's going on here? Are they trying to show me I'm being immature or something?"<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Mommy they seem perfectly clear to me would you like me to explain anything. I can see yes everything you weren't very sure about okay Mommy hair curlers means go be who your makeover reminded you of the Strawberry Princess that the simple way out of this where I exist and you don't create something like Eden. Aliens Seargant nuclear weapons means you would have to destroy everything like you said it does but what would the site be it would have to be everything our whole existence is wound all around this stuff. Isht Visht as the Enterprise I said saving you but I still say the same thing you can't take this Mommy it's killing you!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Good little seer, all that makes sense except the curlers thing. We know it can't be 'go be the Strawberry Princess' because I founded a religion. Maybe you disagree or the Dreams do but I don't believe there's any such thing as a religion that isn't just another one of Eden deep down even if it's not technically whatever Eden was. Suppose there was, though, their goddess has been completely fake all this time! If they want a sexy divine force they should get a real one like the Dreams, not waste their time pining for my pathetic ass because I happened to look especially hot for five minutes by accident this once--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The Dreams interrupt to show me an electric fan. Chill out? I'm not getting it again cocksleeve, interpret.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I see you yes Mommy that means you have fans that's all religion is really it's fandom. They know you aren't coming back to save them Mommy you did that already at the castle by making their world open."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"It doesn't change the fact that there are millions of people out there just waiting for their punching bag to come out and play. I guess when you strip this all down that's still what it's really about."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The Dreams show me Lyra again, plain and simple, just her pretty silver features.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"That's for you, I have no idea what they're saying anymore."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Maybe we should talk out loud more. It's really nice to hear her voice.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"What if they're hoping to meet you like Rada because they believe in you, Mommy? That wouldn't be so bad would it? I love you and I'm your fan and I'm not anything like you think of them and I already did call you goddess I only stopped because you said Mommy instead now. Why can't you believe they can be that way if I can? They don't have to be your submissives like me to want to see what you play like! Can't you imagine that even a little bit? Remember the castle they were kneeling for you? Don't you want to try that but have more than five minutes to play with it? Don't you want to know what that would feel like?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Well, you actually got me to smile right into your sexy head--does your <i>hair</i> taste like you-flavor cotton candy?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Oh probably I seem to be candy everywhere.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">That gets a giggle despite everything. I just sit there for a while, feeling defeated but letting her body comfort me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Finally I can talk.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I still don't understand why my game set me off. I wasn't okay, but I might have had an experience of what you just described. I think there was a little part of me that was hoping to. Why not let me get hooked on it and see it's a thing to entice me out of this if I'm really stuck in some kind of delusion--the fuck?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The Dreams pounce on my question with an adorable image of Lyra with pink roses in her hair.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Until we get out of this cocksleeve just assume the Dreams are talking to you because I just can't get them anymore."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Mommy I know what that means but you're not going to like it please listen until I'm done telling you."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Okay, but it's hard to imagine not liking you looking like that..."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Hehe Mommy I love you too but this is serious let me keep telling you. The thorns on my head are the dark side of being a princess all the stuff you were saying about bones and things. That's all the parts you can see right now you can't see the pretty nice flowers. The plan you were making with Rarity had lots of thorns and not much flowers and you were furious that she would challenge you by showing up with that walker and all of your plan was to show her you're more powerful as scary as you could possibly make it. That's not the Strawberry Princess but you know that I see you you said inside this way I'll destroy her completely and no one will like me if I'm mean when I come back for Rarity. Mommy why do you hate this so much it's beauitful! Can't you see that there's fun in it? Can't you see the nice roses the thorns come with?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I'm either too wise or to burned out to answer at first. I sit more, clutching her like when we went to see G1 My Little Pony in the theatre.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">About five times I almost dreamtalk Mama that I'm just not ready for this and can I please come home and just be Lucy. I start crying pathetically after the first one. I don't do it each time because it won't help. Mama will understand and so will Rarity probably but it doesn't change that I can't leave our house. Probably the only reason we don't have an entourage flying here is nobody knows I fly an Arwing.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Can I? If we just don't tell anyone can my appearance just be a weird coincidence like that army of blue butterfly sluts I saw? Cocksleeve?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">And I <i>don't</i> hate this I don't think. I just can't live up to it yet. I don't know what that was at the castle, but it wasn't just simply me. I must have been helping myself from the future like with Cleavage. I couldn't have written that speech if I worked on it for ten years.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy how could you get there it was already so hard just that one time how could you possibly get back again? The Dreams kept interrupting me but no I can't get back there now Mommy. There's not enough left of you still in that moment in the room we made special to conflate with.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy you're so beautiful in your crown and your slippers but if you take them off yes you might just be someone who looks like the Strawberry Princess by accident.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The poor thing is terrified. How can this happen here? Didn't I just tell Mama <i>her </i>story had something way too sad in it?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Something collides with us from underneath suddenly, kicking the seat into my ass and setting the velocity vectors on the HUD dancing. A collision alarm goes off, after the fact, but StarFox's proximity warning is nowhere to be heard.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"What the fuck--someone else cloaked! Wait, cocksleeve, aren't we phased!? Can't we <i>not </i>be collided with!?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">EEP CRASHING!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes Mommy everything should just go through without touching us!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I peer around, trying to get a look below, then remember this is a spaceship and not an airplane and roll us upside down.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">There's nothing there.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Could another phased ship collide with us?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"No it's a unique phase alignment every five seconds to keep anyone from guessing."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Dreams?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">They don't respond.</p>
