<article class="chapter 91---uncloaking">
    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">91 - Uncloaking</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>BLAM&nbsp;</i>the sound of a novabomb explosion&nbsp;<i>right here</i>&nbsp;shakes the whaleship before I can start reading as one physically in the room with us explodes its starburst and shockwave through the room and the bass shock hits us fun-hard not breaking things--oooh.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">EEP WINGS AND TAIL SO TIGHTLY DOWN!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Out of the blastwave and spiky starburst cloud of plasma there appears a green checkmark as big as the width of the whole room. It sparkles, fades, and my game's map screen comes over my vision in the process off becoming a mission-briefing screen because I've just picked a stage just like how that starts with a novabomb explosion in StarFox CD.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">In the center, instead of a planet or Sector, is a midnight-blue pony--<i>Mama!?</i>&nbsp;She really does look like Luna, but Soefta'xrn isn't anime, or at least Mama's not. Beside her, where General Pepper would be in StarFox, is what could be an especially adventurous episode of Friendship is Magic, grabs my attention:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Waves, a stormy night at sea, anime--there's Mama!<i>&nbsp;</i>A midnight-blue pony with her mane slicked down by rain looks up at something, then grabs hauls on a rope with her mouth and then we see her little sailboat from above, shooting across the waves at full sail even though the wind is insane.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh. <i>Duh.&nbsp;</i>Cocksleeve, I don't think Isht Visht is your&nbsp;<i>sister</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Your seedling didn't think she was actually because yes it feels like kid but how can that be she said she must be wrong it must be sister. Princess this is horrible look what's happening!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Lightning flashes, Saint Elmo's fire glows from the mast-top, we see Mama desperately working with ropes, she kicks at the tiller with her hind legs and then falling sails and mast cover her--Mama! Huge waves toss her little boat and huge cartoonish lightning fills the sky. She fights free of the fallen sails and rigging and stands tall but looks ahead in hard-faced terror--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">WHAT!? NO!! GASP RADA!!!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She dances back and forth in the boat's cockpit, then kneels and covers her head with her forelegs and shakes. The scene changes and the black-silhouette green-glowing ghost of Strawberry Castle looms on the horizon turned into a terrible nightmare zombie Mordor version of itself looms over her boat, we see pony-Rada cowering in her boat again as everything glows creepy green with the light of oncoming catapult rocks.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's an awful&nbsp;<i>crash</i>, and there she is with her face just sticking out of the water in the middle of a cloud of floating wreckage. She struggles to get on something, but there aren't any fragments big enough to do anything but just spin and sink under her hooves and she's crying but I know those tears aren't because she's afraid she'll drown&nbsp;<i>this is why we're we're seeing this and she NEEDS US Dreams come ON let's go!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's a blinding flash and some kind of energy bolt splashes off an invisible dome of shield around Mama and she's raised out of the waves to stand on the wooden deck of the conning tower of some huge steely craft, winces at the flashes of what must be more incoming fire, and then we're watching the propellors of a huge dieslpunky submarine dark underwater as it sails away.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">This is to tell her story Princess. This isn't what really happened literally.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">So she went looking for the real Strawberry Dynasty, and what she found wasn't pretty, and then on top of it she found out she couldn't take it on alone and that shattered her dreams of being the Strawberry Princess' hero that only her skills and ship could save, despite Melody coming to personally comission her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That isn't fair. She wanted to be the fizzfreezing chosen one, she should get to be.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now a cartoon training montage, she's sparring with a two-legs who uses a staff while a portrait of, ulp, me, hangs over the scene, now she's in a deep blue cloak on a rock towering over a crowd of people looking Imposing--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I should at&nbsp;<i>least&nbsp;</i>get to get her Isht Visht! She'll still a pony so she doesn't have her yet. Why wait?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A nice midriff with a navel piercing, then Mama lying on her bed with her legs folded under her, looking at a book with argh blush hi self in a classic sexy posy stretched with my arms over my head and text that has to be a Starlight Princess story on the other page. Her horn is glowing with telekinesis and we can't see what she's grabbing but don't need to.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>Well then why isn't Isht Visht--</i>no, because she has that thing with the Real One.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Flying into the gate of a castle, then swooping around to see Mama huge outside it because it's a model. She's talking to Rarity, has her cloak on, so does Rarity, and sunglasses. The scene changes and they're together outside a castle with a round tower, wearing hehe flaxen-blonde wigs and they're not in the Painted Sea anymore because nothing is cartoon here. Oh&nbsp;<i>no&nbsp;</i>Strawberry Dynasty ren faires exist&nbsp;<i>aah!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Another scene change, that shield spell is protecting Mama from dragon fire now, she puts her head down and braces her forelegs and grits her teeth and fires a blinding-white beam from her horn, then we see her on her bed again, just sitting daydreaming--oh frizzfrozen jolly rancher cumsplats these are Mama's&nbsp;<i>fantasies</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Smoke rises in blackness, Mama in her cloak seems to be looking for something, she shines a beam from her horn and swings it all around like a searchlight, it faces our view and makes everything white.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Cutting cake, rainbow-frosted, a birthday. Colorful balloons by the dozens, the kind of fancy decorations you'd expect from Rarity, who's cutting her kids cake. Mama's small, bigger than the fillies in Friendship is Magic but not much. It's her Sweet Sixteen or Just-Ripe or whatever because here's pony-form Boobsong showing up and bristling my commision at Mama with her sweet intensity.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A rush of images now, Mama running off, hauling her little sailboat into the water, sailing away in it, the weather's nice but she's hauling the lines with the same fury and gritted teeth as in the fantasy with the storm. Then my Earth-Mom taking her crown off, giving it to someone, climbing down into the worldgate and onto the radio tower on top of green-top.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Mama sailing seen from above, there's a stiff breeze and she's going&nbsp;<i>somewhere&nbsp;</i>fast. We can hear her talking to her boat, I can't understand her but that's not the point because watching her I have a sudden pang of remembering being four and duct-taping a black extension cord to the back of a plastic ride-on tractor I had then, thinking with my conscious mind that&nbsp;<i>somehow</i>&nbsp;this should make the tractor move while (I can see now that I'm Princess Starlight) my heart was saying&nbsp;<i>maybe this will put my pony friend back together</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The video loops, so I turn to the breifing text:</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Even after reincarnation, Sapphire feels connected to Earth and drawn to Starlight Princess songs and toys as long as she remembers. Help her find her fantasy and make her dream come to life."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Wait <i>reincarnation </i>seven layer pixie stix cake&nbsp;<i>WHAT--</i>there's a StarFox level-start sound, and then the announcer:</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Good luck!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Jounrey takes us. Mama in her boat is ahead of us now--oops, she's getting away! Fuck fuck fuck what are we even doing here no time umumum--I'm riding Boobsong in pony-form, so I nudge her forward, zoom over her boat and then turn to face her, make Boobsong fly backward to keep position over her boat--hold us in place, little one.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Mama&nbsp;<i>kneels</i>, pony-style--Mama!?&nbsp;<i>Context</i>, self. I guess she can see us, then, what--DUH. This is the Sugarfeast where she implanted Isht Visht! Didn't she say she went sailing?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Does Mama even need Sugarfeast? Earth is one thing, getting people to even see what'@ possible and give themself enough kindness to dare wish for it there takes about as much drama as me and Boobsong can put out which is really saying something, but Mama knows that stuff better than I do, and has no problem making wishes, as we found out over ice cream, but somehow I manage to realize the reason the Dreams just showed her story even though we know it already as a guide for this and ruthless furious reflex takes over because I am the Sugarfeast Fairy and my little help is between my knees and we didn't come this far&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>to give Mama her Strawberry Dynasty fantasy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Let's get Christmas Carol. I am the spirit of Sugarfeast future MUAHAHAH! I raise a hand, make like I'm going to talk, shine blindingly enough to give her spots for a few hours, Acme Station can you teleport us behind her if not game do it or pause.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">YesshecanPrincessPRAH!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Instantly we're right behind Mama's black-spots-on-blue-fur rump, good terrifying pocket singularity. Now put my voice in her ears, Acme Station.&nbsp;Physical and spooky ghost voice, move it around so she keeps looking the wrong way, watch me thinking and make the sound, but don't make it scary gonna get you, make it scary lost little girl like that one horrible Twilight Zone. If she looks our way teleport&nbsp;<i>just&nbsp;</i>after she sees us so she'll wonder if she imagined it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Reverb and spooky wisps ready!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">And get your creative drama on, creepy outside context problem!&nbsp;I make my thoughts soft and cute-sexy-Princess, letting Boobsong do all the creepy work for extra damsel in cosmic distress dissonance:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">«Rise, Rada of&nbsp;Soefta'xrn, heroine of time.»</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Wait, how the fuck am I speaking Infernal!?&nbsp;<i>Soefta'xrn </i>means <i>Soefta-playworld </i>but how can I know that!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">No time! The only tricky part is going to be keeping this spooky until I get to the&nbsp;<i>this.&nbsp;</i>I'm not sure what&nbsp;<i>this&nbsp;</i>is--no! Obviously! BWAHAHA HOW IS IT SO PERFECT!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She stands, turns he hear, I can see her eye for a blink--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Prah.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We're off her port bow, now, looking back.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">«You've seen the fortress they have me in--»</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Prah.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Starboard beam.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">«--in your fantasies. Your dreams. Your&nbsp;<i>nightmares.</i>»</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Prah.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Port, astern.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">«It's so much scarier than you think. Please help me.»<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Prah.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Starboard bow, now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">«I'm not afraid, Princess! Tell me where to look for you, please, and I'll come for you!»</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Prah.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Port beam, but high up--nice, cocksleeve.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Mama speaks Infernal back to me, and somehow, impossibly, I can understand her, weirdly half-familiar like seeing Java the first time and knowing C. My sight wavers with tears as I realize it's just that I have enough memory back to hear Infernal and understand some of it.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">«<i>You will be.&nbsp;</i>Search outside time and beyond death. You will be as lost as I am--»<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Prah. Fake buouy sound effect off her starboard bow so she'll look for it while you talk to her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Mama leaps to her starboard rail, trying to see where the ghostly, distorted-sounding bell is coming from.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">«--and you'll think I'm safe over and over and <i>over&nbsp;</i>only to have to find me all over again and your journey won't end until on the day you finally find me for real I'm unrecognizable and you die in my arms and our life begins.»<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's working, keep up the creepy sea-of-ghosts stuff, Acme Station!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Add spooky ghost seagull sounds where can they be from there's no land in sight!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">«That's not a metaphor. I see the future. I feel your heart stop. I said only your experience, and skills, and ship can rescue me, but you don't have them yet. The road to find them is thousands of years, but you deserve to live before you die for me, and you have to. They're holding me in a timeless prison that only opens when my rescuer forgets everything that was dear to her and sits on a boat in paradise pining for the end. I'll be the first stranger to stand by your helm as heroine of time, and the last.»</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay game I need the toy I'm imagining for this scene and it needs to work like I imagine and be&nbsp;<i>nice.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: my game will put it in the air right between us when it's time for it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Perfect. Acme Station land us on her deck right in front of her with a nice big&nbsp;<i>thud&nbsp;</i>and be in demon-girl form snuggled up to me and give her a big dose of&nbsp;<i>look what a loyal handmaid this cocksleeve is</i>&nbsp;right as I get to the start of the quote and then remind me later I have a translation job to mess with and do&nbsp;<i>this&nbsp;</i>translation job completely normal-sounding so it's really convincing that we're actually there.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Ready!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">«This is a long voyage, and not an easy one, Rada.»<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Prah super quietly change to demon form pop fall to deck with you STOMP then snuggle close and hard looking up so submissively.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We're right in front of her, and her head snaps around, mouth open in surprise, to look at us.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">«It's dangerous to go alone. Take this.»<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Sparkling and shining into existence between us, a thick green wooden strap-on and harness made of heartstone with straps made to work for either her pony-form or the two-legs shape I know she'll have appears, Mama stares and jumps for it, and the journey breaks--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>Got you.</i>&nbsp;Now come get me Mama, I can remember how much trouble I was in!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--and we go right into the next one.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">...which is just watching this journey from outside. Mama takes the harness with her magic, fits it on, looks surprised when she realizes she can feel the shaft like it's her own cock, and starts undoing ropes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She's chanting something as she works, her voice suddenly milky and confident:</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">«My heart is a Monster's heart yet I hear love in every heartbeat.»<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She has the sail down and is neatly tying it to the boom in no time, but she's using her teeth instead of magic--<i>skills,&nbsp;</i>go Mama!</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">«My eyes are a Monster's eyes, and I see lovely terrible things everywhere I turn them.»<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now she's undoing the lines that steady the mast, working fast, talking around the rope in her mouth.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">«I feel with a Monster lips, and the taste of violence is sweet to me.»<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She's...taking the mast down? She picks it up with her magic carefully, pulling it out of--OOOH. YEAH! Snifflesob GO MAMA!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">HOLY FUCK THAT'S BEAUTIFUL YES THIS IS HOW OUR KID IMPLANTED MOST DEFINITELY!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'd forgotten. It's a very special thing to be there for any implantation, and Sugarfeast was wonderful when we could see our audience, but my favorite ones are when people take our inspiration and come up with something SO MUCH MORE AWESOMELY KINKY than even I would have. The uniqueness of Monstrosity, Sadishness if you want to translate it without changing the name (<i>Sade&nbsp;</i>is the word she's saying Monster by), is one of the best things about it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">«I have the bones of a Monster inside me, and they hold my head high with pride at my scary underpinnings.»<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She holds the mast horizontal with her magic so she can work along it's length, tying the boom in place along it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">«I'm the worst thing you can imagine, and the best one you ever want to!»<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now she's tying the mast securely along the rail of her boat, inside the gunwale. It's obviously supposed to be stored there, but it looks kinky with bondage knots instead of sailor's half-hitches all along its length.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">«I'm Sade, and my journey into the darkness of my heart is just beginnging!»<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We're watching from low in the bow, now. She whips her cloak off and folds it, twists it into a narrow shape with her magic.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">«Come with me, I fucking dare you!»<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now we're overhead. She fits the shape into the hole where the mast was, spreads the end of it and wraps the bracket so it's held in place, rears up to put her front hooves on the brace that runs across the width of the boat to hold the mast--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">RRRAAAAH MAKING SEEDS AAAH!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The journey breaks and there's Boobsong holding the book like she was when this started, eyes wide.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Isht Visht is our <b>kid!? </b>Why is this happening here now!? How did we get there I didn't take us I guess your game did but <b>what?</b>&nbsp;I want my collar you said and BLAM let's go implant Isht Visht your game said like obviously that's the next thing to do but why is that the next thing?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Good questions, curious cocksleeve, but congratulations! Do you think she knows already?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Thank you and congratulations Princess and yes I think she must."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"We're going to have so much fun with this when we get back. Now, game, what the sweet swirly strawberry cum popsicle fizzfrozen fuck?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It shows me a cutesey glittery Chistmas angel-with-trumpet&nbsp;greeting card.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Somehow this is clearing the way to get my collar back, and it has something to do with how you were kind of totally right that she is the Great Pumpkin fuck this let's get reading I bet that explains it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Journey grabs us as soon as I start reading--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Mist hangs in the air like the layers of green and black in the stone the two huge statues on either side of the canal are made of. They're four-legs, of course, looking out at the mist behind where we came from. I can barely see them by the light of the lantern hanging from the front of our boat and little glow-specks floating in the air. Boobsong shifts under me (she's in ponyform for obvious reasons and riding is really kinky here so of course we're doing it) to look around with me. Beyond the heads of the statues and wisps of mist, we can see the lights of the True Sea glowing, but something about this place makes them seem far away, and yet that's right. It'd be weird if it was like Heart Home where it feels like you could pick them out of the sky and eat them like candy and the light is huge and friendly all around you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I glance back to see the Openveil Witch smiling out from under her hood. She has the tiller in one hand and a green lantern on a pole in the other and I can't help thinking she's read A Christmas Carol and is having fun being spookily helpful like the spirit of Christmas Future from it and knows it and intends to be a reference...I mean, if I'm the Sugarfeast Fairy and I'm <i>me, </i>what will the Openveil Witch actually be like?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Did she just <i>wink?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I look ahead again and see we've come into a quiet harbor with smooth water like Grand Lake at night. We're turning to head for a town with neon-colorful lights coming down to the shore to our right.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now we're sitting by a campfire, I'm perched on a log and Boobsong is back in girl ahem <i>two-legs </i>form at my feet and I'm roasting a marshmallow kind of thing on the end of a stick. A shiningly white unicorn pony with deep purple mane and tail sitting beside us is holding a bowl of them with gently-sparkly telekinesis, and is wearing an awesomely sparkly like almost shiny enough for me to wear masquer-ade mask because it's Openveil Eve of course. Boobsong and me are proud because we don't <i>need </i>masks to be monstrously numinous because she's a dragon and I'm a Princess <i>and </i>we're both projecting from the otherworld which gives us a bit of spooky ghostlike feeling just around us already.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Other people with masks and costumes, all four-legs, are sitting here with us, all making toasty snacks and shining bright eyes and sparkly costume parts in the flickery darkness, and the air feels crisp and clear like fall.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Someone in a dark blue cloak appears at the edge of the circle in a gap, but when I look they're gone again. Everyone gets quiet suddenly.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's a sound of flapping cloak, but I don't see anything this time, then--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Aaah!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Wait, the Openveil Witch!? She's standing right in front of us on two legs suddenly, in her dark <i>green </i>cloak with its bronze-and-obsidian joined-hands broach, staff in her hand, looking down from under her hood with that same weird smile. She reaches a hand down like to point at me but it's in a fist that she turns palm-up and opens to reveal...a piece of green bubblegum?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I stare at it and can feel everyone else staring too because it's Openveil Eve and of course you give candy to monsters like me who come to your house bringing numinosity for Openveil to thank them for opening the way for your loved ones <i>but how is this the Openveil Witch's house!?</i>&nbsp;She's usually the one <i>getting </i>candy because having the Openveil Witch herself come is what you get if you stay up late enough and have spooky cool enough light calling out to the otherworld which I guess this fire counts as but her <i>giving </i>candy like it's her house we're at is...what does that <i>mean!?</i>&nbsp;I take the gum and eat it right away--ooh not gum saltwater taffy of course because her helper is her ship like Boobsong is my Sugarfeast handmaiden--and she disappears in a whoosh of her cloak.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The journey ends and--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--I'm on my back on some kind of bed or something looking up at firelight on the vaulted ceiling of what has to be Strawberry Home and it's smelly but it'll be okay Colleen is changing me (<i>wow </i>I didn't think these&nbsp;<i>could </i>go back that far) and she's so big and comforting though it's kind of scary how the light only shines on her mouth for a second as she comes to shuzz-shuzz-shuzz me--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>"WWWWWHAT!?"</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess handmaiden hears glomping book down beside us SNUGGLE!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"M...<i>Mama!? Cocksleeve I <b>know</b> just read it back to me storybook what did the briefing say."</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Ulp...snif...why couldn't storybook see her face?! I was there in that memory!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Even after reincarnation, Sapphire feels connected to Earth and drawn to Starlight Princess songs and toys as long as she remembers. Help her find her fantasy and make her dream come to life."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Because if you'd remembered you'd have screwed up your plan to glitch us into fucking! We never would have been able to if we didn't think we were just playing house! <i>Is</i> this wrong? I'm grown up now--does she know--holy fizzfrozen nectar conversation hearts I mean--obviously hyperintelligent you didn't think it was wrong--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="v5MELBxAO"><strike><i>Top, Discover your changes internally by being examined through physical contact, Separate cock can be reattached</i><br></strike></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Sobbing and laughing:&nbsp;"OH MY STRAWBERRY CUMDAE NUTS ONLY <i>YOU</i> COULD MAKE ME CRY WITH A DICK JOKE! YEAH SEPARATE COCK MY STRAPON-OBSESSED NURSEMAID IS SURE REATTACHED NOW!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: my nursemaid is having the same revelation. She'll know when we see her again. This isn't wrong, we're grown up and beyond the world that maid us baby Princess and nursemaid and it's okay if it makes us feel happy to keep going as nursemaid and teenage princess as a game to help us feel at home in our life here.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Your game made the joke up so I can't say it's mine but I say YAY I'M SO HAPPY WE HAVE COLLEEN!! I thought she was changed or didn't want to be nursemaid to you when you're grown up but nope here she is! I missed her so bad!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Me too. I called them Mommy and Mama, right? To keep them straight so I could cry for the one I wanted then? I was that spoiled, I'm sure of it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Your storybook just says Colleen is back yay. She still can't remember stuff like that."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Okay. There'll be a good reason. Hug you now."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Squeezing rraaah hug you back super tight!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Now I <i>really </i>want her to read us stories! No wonder she's obsessed with Strawberry Dynasty stuff. That's why her showing us Friendship is Magic made me freak out like that, too, she showed it to me like a storybook first, and she just made me breakfast, and she was going to do my hair...I must have remembered <i>something</i>, we both must. I guess reincarnation doesn't wipe the slate <i>entirely </i>clean."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Another briefing screen comes up--holy fizzfrozen walnuts on my Happy Ending Sundae if the Openveil Witch is Mama and Mama is <i>Colleen </i>who's <i>NEXT!?</i></p>
