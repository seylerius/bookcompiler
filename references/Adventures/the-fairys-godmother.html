<article class="chapter 74---the-fairys-godmother">
    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">74 - The Fairy's Godmother</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: this game is designed to keep my life safe from the way having my house on display for the diocese made being a preist's kid terrible. Rarity can't bring those cameras inside here, if she wants to be able to meet me. Even the windows are one-way and shielded to scrying unless its just the family around. Outside it's raining and windy, and Rarity's cameras can't see anything through it. Everything in the grounds and around them is secret and private, just for our family. The picture Mama sent her through dreamtalk showed inside the living room, so the Dreams won't let her share it publicly--which means the epic reveal I'm planning is safe no matter what happens here. It also means I can relax and stop shaking.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">It's right, I feel terrified. Just when I start to feel safe something new happens! I had fun at the castle just for five minutes but I don't want to be a celebrity! It was bad as a preist's kid and I don't think even the Dreams can fix it for someone who just doesn't like that kind of constant flaw-finding scrutiny. How can Lyra and I explore that cool city we saw while we were landing the Waifu with everyone there watching for me to make one tiny fuckup and wanting attention no matter how much I don't know who they are? Sure my game can control me and make me act perfect, but that's just a cutscene, I want to play the game!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">That experience at the castle made me feel like I'm born and bred for this, but that's five minutes to a lifetime of misery, and yet in those five minutes I felt like I knew at last what I was made for. I said lots things about love and redemption when my game nudged me into them, but maybe the real truth is, it's totally possible, and probably the easiest and most likely thing, to create a monster who can be good and have love in its heart without being something it isn't, that can still never be happy. Even the Dreams can't do <i>everything.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">At least we have this cool house to retreat to. Good cocksleeve seeing so well how I felt about that. I'm attached to this shape and this makeup and my crown is <i>beautiful</i>, but maybe it's time to play handmaid eternally. You have the power the book said, don't you?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Gasp omifuck I do and it's always been there from the beginning that's awesome!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Game I need to spend time going through Lyra's powers with her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="v5MELBxAO"><i>Top, Make character sheet out for Lyra, Penny wonderful escape hatch</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The Dreams have been patiently waiting while I enjoy my heartchild, but now they show me...Han Solo frozen in carbonite? My heart is cold or something? It feels that way! No, that's wrong, um, oh. I'm supposed to be Mama's trophy, like Han in his carbonite. It'd be mean to take that from her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Fuck. What have I blundered into. It sounded hot when it was just Mama enjoying me, but now I have to do everything that made me suicidal--I can see that I was now, I never looked at it straight but I always acted as if I wouldn't make it to adulthood--as a priest's kid. The job is the same, it's just the clothes are different. So much for escaping Earth, we may as well have just stayed in Stamford! I'm sorry, cocksleeve. I guess this is the best even the Dreams can do for me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Game, do it. Just make me a puppet. I can't do this myself. That's why you exist, right? The best I can hope is to give other people happiness, never have it myself, and I need you to carry me as I crumble away inside? Don't let them see. At least let them pretend. You too, cocksleeve.</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"What's got into you, Lucy? You look like I just gave you a heart-stop pill, not said you were Batman! Gender aside, you know what I mean. I should have used Barbie or something--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"You're fine, Isht Visht. It's just, being Batman <i>is </i>a heart-stop pill for me. I don't know what that was at the castle, some kind of magic or something, but I could barely handle having one failing church paparazzi me, let alone all of the Four Dreams. We did what we had to for everyone, but this is going to cost me for eternity. It kind of wrecks the whole thing for me. I'm here for you guys, and I hope I can make you all happy, but this is my hell now. Not because of Rarity! Just--this house is my world now, because out there is everything I would still have had to leave Earth to get away from whether Lyra could live there with me or not."</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Alright I'm marching you out there. Trust me on this, okay girl? You just have to go out and meet Rarity. Not see the whole thing at one time. Take the first step, that's everything as Captain would say."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Holy fuck, game why are you letting me be such a bitch? I thought this was what you're supposed to keep me from doing! I probably just tore Mama's heart out!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: I'm supposed to keep just doing whatever it lets me do. That was okay if it let me do it. This is part of the steps to being a family. Now I can see what they do when I need some help with the role I'm in.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Just let me put these plates down--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Whatever. I'm out, game. I'm falling over now. Puppet me or let me smash my face, I give no shits. You can't help this time, cocksleeve, but I love you for wanting to. With a gentle hand, I still all of her strings but the balance to keep the plates up.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">It's surprisingly hard to get my own built in reflexes to let me just fall, but if I shut my eyes, I can let my balance start drifting, and go as floppy as possible with the need to keep holding my eravahk (which I wouldn't let go of anyway, I still want you cocksleeve there's just no room to enjoy you in the existence ahead of us).</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Dreams if you're not going to stop me fucking this up for everyone else and my game's not I wish to just take Lyra and be however far from here I have to go to be where nobody has or ever will hear of the Strawberry Dynasty. I wish for what I said I would have done without Mama and Isht Visht--cocksleeve you'll still hang out with your sister on dreamtalk or whatever we just need to get the fuck away from here if I can't check out some other way.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Their response is the beloved uncle I saw my dad sailing with, a soccer ball, and the plastic grass from an Easter basket.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The distraction of the puzzle pulls me away from the determination not to move the feet that are trying to stumble under my swaying form--apparently even my game is abandoning me now--to figure it out as heaven (uncle Richard alive and free of the hardbitten sadness that hung over him in life) kicks (soccer ball) the priest's kid stuff (Easter being the most stressful church holiday after Christmas and lacking both presents and my dad taking no calls nor going anywhere without the family on Christmas day).</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">You can kick it as far as you want, Dreams, I'll still be myself, and I need this role, and I hate it. We just went through how you'll be Frankenstein and not Jesus if you try to fix that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I shrug inside and replant my feet. Maybe that's for the best. I want to die anyway, and at least then my family will have someone who can make them happy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The quoozyness of falling--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">I WANT THIS MOMMY NOT A DIFFERENT ONE! PLATES DOWN TURN TO FACE YOU AND HOLD YOU UP RRRAH STRONG I CAN BEAR YOU IN THIS SHAPE NOT JUST PONY FORM!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Lyra's hands on my body feel nice but cocksleeve let go I told you to be still. I know why you're doing it but stop, that's an order.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">MOMMY I NEED YOU STOP DOING THIS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE BAD JUST TRY TO BELIEVE--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Oh. She needs me, the game wouldn't...you'll have me in our alone times I guess, assuming my game gives us any and assuming it's not like Earth where it's not really alone because all the people watching need to not see any evidence of anything bad and assuming we don't spend all of them working through my issues and stuff like that ride in the Waifu. I guess if I have those to look forward to I can get through a pretty good amount of hell.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I can't quite open my eyes, but I get my feet under me and let her actually hold me up instead of clenching her still harder.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">MOMMY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE LIKE IT WAS HOW CAN YOU THINK THAT AFTER EVERYTHING WAKE UP MOMMY THAT'S NIGHTMARES THIS ISN'T EARTH ITS THE FOUR DREAMS IT CAN MAKE ANYTHING GOOD YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ENOUGH AT LEAST TO LOOK AT IT BY NOW AFTER EVERYTHING COME ON MOMMY JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU MEET RARITY!!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Rarity is fine. It's the being served up on a platter for everyone to pick apart that's the problem, which would be fine except apparently I can't just hide out either. I'll just keep putting us in harm's way. It can't make good something I inherently hate but am compelled from inside to do anyway. Hell is inside me, like I thought when we were looking at Rl'yeh Sade the first time. Even you can't save me from that. Let's just get through until our next alone time. I'll have as much fun as I can with the family, they still rule, this is just a really heavy thing to learn I have hanging over me and it's got me down until I can forget about it for a while.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Can I open my eyes or move? No, though only because my own heart is too cold to do it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Oh my god I'm so stupid. Cocksleeve, this is easy! Let's fry me right now! Then I won't care, right? I won't even understand I bet! Game, get my clit on me, cocksleeve, this time don't save me but damn--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">MOMMY I'M SERIOUS IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS IN YOUR PARENTS HOUSE THIS IS DIFFERENT--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><b>"ALL CELEBRITY OF ANY KIND IS HELL!!!!!!!"</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The sound rattles glass and makes the silverware on the plates at our feet clatter.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I don't know what to do. There's no evil god to slay, no universe of suffering to take revenge on, no empire of blood to grind to dust under a mountain of beautiful porn. Just me, and the hell inside me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">And the misery I'm bringing to my poor family, but the game took away my ability to play-act, or I'd choose differently.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">If it didn't mean abandoning Lyra I'd kill myself on the spot. Now, I don't know what to do.</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"I don't find it that way--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I'm sorry. I just mean for me."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Such a bitch such a bitch such a bitch game where did you GO.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: my game is still holding me like it was before Rarity got here.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The family sure wouldn't know it!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">MOMMY PLEASE JUST TRY TO MEET RARITY OUT BY HER WALKER I KNOW YOU WANT TO MAKE A BIG COMEBACK SO MAKE ONE IT'S PERFECT WITH THUNDER AND LIGHTNING AND EVERYTHING!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">What the hell where is this coming from how do I know what to do here. My eyes finally obey the order to open, and I can stand up straight.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Mama, Isht Visht, I'm not leaving or running away and I'm sorry for being such a bitch just now. Cocksleeve, how do we get to the hangar. There'll be a fire pole or something cool, right?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Mommy I can shadowjump right there if you want me to would you like me to there's a place by entry door and a place in the hangar so I can take you right away if you decide you want to go flying. I can go to our room to if you want to get ready first."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Perfect and if I understood that I'm going to fuck you later just for the amazingness of your being able to actually jump out from under beds and stuff. Mama, no really seriously I'm so so sorry I feel like such a bitch. I need--I'm calling my add-one-thing to add my jacket. Is there..."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">No, that's right, the Waifu's cockpit will still be a mess. The jacket's not too messy. <i>I'm too clean.</i>&nbsp;Cocksleeve, check my purse. Still nice and full and fresh?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Purse, match my crown, still be heart-shaped but match colors and have a sparkly expensive strawberry on your side like my crown.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Checking ziip whee it changing feels weird while I touch it yes Mommy tasty good cum filling all of it. Rezip.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Good. I'd just cum some fresh but I'm in a <i>mood </i>and we're in a <i>hurry</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"...I need my jacket and I'm sorry I hope my game lets me make it up to you."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Klapta her jacket, scoot. Boobsqueeze you're face would fry lightning what are you planning here?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Everyone wants to see the Strawberry Goddess come back. Fine. <i>GREEN CHECKMARK</i>."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The plan is there, blurry, fading into detail like a hologram whose parts get reassembled.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">My eyes are locked on Lyra where she's still hugging me, but it's hard to ignore Isht Visht holding my jacket up, still covered in cum--perfect. Cocksleeve, get that on me ASAP.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes Mommy let go and get jacket so tasty cum don't lick it we need it take jacket to Mommy behind her arms up please thanks Mommy that's helpful you put them behind you slide the sleeves up your arms both at once cause we're hurrying put jacket over your shoulders and reach up to make sure it's adjusted now get in front to see if your breasts need adjusting they don't do some anyway hehe!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Being fondled feels like it brings me back to myself some--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The Dreams show me a bowling ball hitting pins.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Strike! Okay, then I won't look stupid or like a bitch if I try <i>that</i> part, right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Ziploc bags? OMIGOD NO LOCK USE THE FORCE LUKE THE FIVE POINTED STAR DOESN'T DESCRIBE YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR AT ALL!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Wait, oh, no lock. If that will get them that is <i>such </i>a better idea! Cocksleeve this house is like, <i>sturdy</i>, right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy YES. It can take it we have to do lots of them this will be totally metal I can't wait to see Rarity's face!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">With the jacket on I--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Mama SHOES I'm meeting Rarity do you have some shoes that'll impress her you don't mind me getting cum all over?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Where even is Mama? Her voice is near. She must be so crushed after my freakout...oh, right in front of me behind Isht Visht. Hi Mama. She looks...just peaceful?</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Let me talk for just five minutes before you go make your entrance, Klapta. There's time till the timelike intersection point as long as we keep needing to do things. I hear that you're sorry for what you said just now and I'm glad that you care so much about my feelings but I don't think you need to be. Your game told me everything while you were standing trying to make it take over for you. You don't need to tell me celebrity has ups and downs to it! I grew up with the person out there in that walker, remember! Have some faith in the Dreams, Klapta, they can make this alright for you. They made it alright for me, and I'm not so different from you in some ways."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Isht Visht opens her hyperspace cupboard as she talks, and Mama reaches in for something.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"For one, I hate to be criticized even by my own family! Strangers can take their opinions overboard which is where they'll be going if they tell me how to run my ship even slightly! You don't seem like you feel different to my eyes--my being your Mama is special if I can give you advice like this! Don't think I found it so easy to take advice from my Mama. We had our hard times and good ones. She'll be horrified by this house of ours, and I can't wait to see it! I'm still very happy to see her, but I see you understand what I mean by this on your face now. Imagine that whole world you're afraid to have criticize you is your Rarity! Don't you want to have fun with it? Isht Visht is my castle and kingdom, and I guess you feel like Lyra's your handmaid, but out there Boobsqueeze is your empire! Go out there and <i>take it! </i>I'm a pirate, remember, that's just a queen with a castle that's mobile!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Mama comes out of the cupboard, smiling happily.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"These shoes came out of <i>your</i>&nbsp;castle. I bet they fit perfectly!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">She's holding out a pair of strappy, jewel-encrusted high heels that match my crown with big ruby strawberries on the forefeet being the most solid part other than the (skimpy) soles.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"You really are the coolest mom. Cocksleeve, get those on me. Mama, THANK YOU, but how--how??"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Take shoes from Rada kneel at your feet and wait till you present me one. Presenting okay slip right shoe on straps adjust no I guess its just made for you slide your foot in--it fits Mommy put your foot down!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">It does fit perfectly. I set my foot down, put some weight on it...the ball and a place in front of my heel complain a little for a moment, but it's otherwise...kind of alright? I bet nectar totally gave me high-heels superpowers or something. And somehow the same size feet as my--fuck, as the previous queen--or something? Later when I accumulate a properly royal amount of fancy shoes, there's going to be <i>explanations.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I lift my other foot.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Slip the other shoe onto you make sure it's adjusted good kiss your foot by the strawberry to say it's ready.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Fuck but foot-kissing is hot. Oh my, heels make me even more stupidly tall! They're also way less uncomfortable than everyone says--I wonder how long it'll take me to eat those words?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Game, please puppet me to look hot walking in these--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: I can be sure I'll look hot without the game's help. The skills of my true life as a girl from my early years have come back enough that I can do it now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I take a tentative step forward, then skip backward, all perfectly fine--no <i>way.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"You read the Five-Pointed Star, I heard you tell my Klapta. Don't you remember when Dreamer brought the rock back to open a gateway with? That's not metaphorical, Boobsqueeze, most people in the Four Dreams get here that way! You made an army get naked, I can do a little shopping in anyone's castle I like if their world is ending! There are lots of things I stole in those five minutes waiting for us in my cargo hold. I think we'll have fun going through them! Let's get you down to your Arwing now. I'm very curious what it is you're planning!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I love you so much, Mama. I can't wait. Ready, cocksleeve? Mama you might have to open the door for us depending on how I do this. I'm kind of making this up as I go along."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I'll be waiting and curious!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"You'll wanna watch out the windows. Let's go, cocksleeve."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I hold out my hand to her--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Oooh! Wait! Isht Visht, would it be a big deal for you to make a metaphasic shield generator that can fit an Arwing, and Mama do you mind?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I don't mind, but now I'm very much more curious what you'll be doing out there!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Sis that's mostly a software thing, you want me to just hand the code to you? Here, I bet you can tail this!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy yes I can you say yes okay. Tail up to sis' ODN port on her forehead hehe this is silly and feels like making out just a little bit. Downloading rrraaah there that's all of it this is simple it's really just that? Okay if that works I can program it easily!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"This is weirdly hot...Mama to answer your question I met someone cool on the way here and I think Rarity will love her."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Bwahahaa zzzap!</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Okay sis you're actually scary what are you guys doing?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"You'll see. Thanks Mama and Isht Visht! Let's go, cocksleeve, for real this time."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I hold out my hand.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Take your hand place is this way in the kitchen by the entry door see it's dark like a hole in space it can be one if you let me carry you just think spooky thoughts of how darkness can be a gate that goes anywhere yes you're doing it ready hold me as I push us back WHEE!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">As we get near the shadow she suddenly grabs onto me and wraps herself around and tips us in and like blinking we're in a nook in what's obviously the hangar. I lead us out and--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Dammit, I forgot about the nacelles! The timelike thing can't possibly give us time to paint them, can it--also that was fucking metal we just jumped out of a shadow like storybook monsters didn't we."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Mommy it can give us years if we need them but the Waifu can change colors to match all your outfits already just tell the computer you want it to."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I love you so much. Let's get in. You control the stairway, right?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Here stairway!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Her voice is even cuter than last time. Slabs rise out of the floor to make an easy path up to the cockpit and I bound up it with her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Computer, open cockpit?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">A Federation fuzzbeep sounds and it slides open, and I hope down into the strawberry-sugar-swirl-reeking cockpit with Lyra in tow, nudge her to sit at my feet.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Computer, close canopy."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Being closed in here with my favored servant and the smell of our last playtime...makes the bloodlust <i>managable.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">This is why I could never function on Earth. Our family seems to be some kind of special case--though I'll notice my closest relationship is still with my totally submissive handmaiden--but a monarch (probably should have seen this when I grew <i>monarch </i>butterfly wings) is a pretty simple kind of monster. Outside, in that world out there, I have two settings: <i>dead, </i>which is what I was just trying to accomplish in the living room and most of my life on Earth, and <b>I AM YOUR QUEEN</b>, which now that as Mama encouraged I've realized is even <i>possible</i> I can feel the ancient terrible drive to do whatever it takes to make sure I'm the one standing on the biggest pile of bones pounding through me especially including those of anyone who thought we should compare piles of bones. If you roll up to my gates with an "army", I'll roll out my bigger one, and that's exactly what's about to happen.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I think I can make something beautiful out of that with this flying arsenal, but the only Reason anyone's going to be listening to in this is the gun from Snowcrash.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The game fucks an order seethingly into my mind: Mama is going to get the show she's been waiting twenty seven thousand years for. Rarity can handle what I'm planning and I'm not going to pull punches just for her sake.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Thanks game, but that was already the plan.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: this order is because Mama asked nicely for my game to make sure I would make this interesting. It knows I will anyway, but now Mama's sure I feel free to have as much fun as I can with this. It's selfish on her part, my game's very sure of that, she wants to have fun with <i>her</i> Mama, and the picture we took made me look sweet and cute.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy that's awesome we can use that I'm sure of it! Can you make something cute happen at the start of this and then it gets super metal and scary afterwards?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Cocksleeve I love you so much. Good advisor. Okay, what can we do? We need to like fly out of a flower or something--do you know this ship or are we learning it together?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">I know every piece of it Mommy I made sure I'd remember and be a good tactical and ops and conn and science and counselor Troi (that's just obvious) all together!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Bad. ass. If you keep loving me this much I'm going to fry just from that! Okay, ideas, cocksleeve! We need something cute to start with, your dragon form has to be in there like maybe I should start riding you in pony-form and transform you into the dragon to roar again and then get in the Waifu? This is why I want ideas. SEX. We have to make this as horny as possible and I'm feeling too violent to think of sexy stuff!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">First off:</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Computer, make the laser nacelles match my crown and shoes."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">It fuzzbeeps confirmation, and when I twist in the seat to look (always a good reminder of having boobs as I pleasurably fail to get my arm out of their way) they're flipping from blue to a nice pinkish strawberry color.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The game is poking at me somehow, and I Dreams-wish it to be fucked off so offhandedly I barely even realize I'm doing it. This is MY show now. It didn't even let Lyra start giving ideas, it's not going to get airtime <i>now.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The dreams respond with an image of Lyra being rolled up to me on a conveyor belt, and the game keeps prodding.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">No idea what that means outside of "won't help you". Fine. Cocksleeve, get us flight-ready and see what we have for novabombs or photon torpedoes. If I'm going to be harassed so I can't think I'll just go with blowing up the storm with as much yield as I can. My order was to give Mama the best show I can but that's all I can think up with the game making my head buzz like this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I settle in the seat--don't dare ask for bondage when it's acting this way--and grab the flight controls.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Power systems on tap the console get my fingers ready here you come LCARS everything online automatically check the tactical full five novabombs Mommy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Check the systems list all things coming on turn the engine on warp drive warming up transwarp calibrated G-diffusers coming up almost ready now we can float if you move the translate-stick or make me take up the landing gear Mommy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Still wrestling with the game's harassing, I consider this smallest of choices. I'd wanted to think this out a lot more. Dreams,&nbsp;<i>please</i>&nbsp;make my game stop trying to take over. This of all things needs to be my scene.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Their response is a silver handgun being racked to put a bullet in the chamber, that is also an NES Zapper, that is also ambiguously either being ridden by Lyra or <i>is </i>Lyra, but it doesn't get the game's trying to fuck a further order into me to stop, and I'm too addled by it to interpret the image.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I'm compelled by the earlier order to keep going, or I'd shut down entirely, tell Lyra to turn everything back off and just sit here catatonic like the depressed Fairies who've lost an essential freedom the book talked about. Cocksleeve, it's not what I want to do but I think you have to just fly this for me. Come up with something good. You're smart. The game wants me out of the picture for some reason.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy why are you saying that it wouldn't take this from you! Just let the order come it's not going to--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Shush. I love you but you don't understand this. It's showing me I'm not in control. That wouldn't hurt you but for me it's taking who I am away from me. If I'm not wanted here let's cut the bullshit and have you fly for me. I'll sit out my own return because it never was about me and I'll screw this up if I fly it or something I guess.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">But I can't stop. With everything in me, all the rage and hate I've found in my battles with Eden remembered, all the lifetime of anger at being somebody's fucking pawn only to think I'd gotten free of that and immediately fall back in and then have Mama give me that moment of believing I could have the freedom back and then get all the way into the cockpit before the game makes it's point again I center my rage on the cock it's trying to fuck me with and stab spikes of solid searing light into the game targeted to just fry everything they can touch.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>This. Is. My. SCENE. <b>DIE!</b></i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Die. Die. DIe. DIE. <b>DIE.</b>&nbsp;<b><u>DIE.</u></b></i></p>
