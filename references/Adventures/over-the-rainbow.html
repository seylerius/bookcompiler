    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">67 - Over The Rainbow</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Bloooooop! Form into cocksleeve demon femme resting agianst Mommy. Hi Mommy!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"You're much more goo than I've been giving you a chance to be, huh."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Shapeshifting is easy for me but I don't mind being the shape you like it just means I can change whenever you want just like now blloooop!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Why is <i>bloooop</i>&nbsp;so sexy. Okay--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Slip. Duh. Okay wait up game, this <i>must </i>count as a toy, porn as girly-sexy-looking as this I'm totally going to end up touching myself or fucking Lyra to--ooooh. After midnight snack, is storytime.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">STORYTIME!? Mommy please yay yes but also when it's our alone time will <b>you</b> read to me?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Yes. Yes I fucking will see how I have to try not to cry now good cocksleeve.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Mama, would you read to us after we're done eating?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I'd be delighted to, pussytaste! We can sit by the fire and feel cozy and comfy. Our fireplace should warm up any cold feet! It's gigantic!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Sweet! Cocksleeve--wait. Mama, I'm just too excited. Would you read us like just the very beginning of the story the bookmark is on?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Let me put down my fork and my knife first."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">She finishes her bite, then turns to take the book and kisses me on the cheek in the process, which can turn me on if it wants to, but what are all of these other feelings?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: I'm starting to feel like I'm really her daughter, and I just got a kiss on the cheek from my Mama. I feel wanted and taken care of now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Oh. My parents wanted me, though. I should know what that feels like.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: I never felt like they wanted me because they were loving the boy they thought they were raising. I was their daughter, not their son. It wasn't that they rejected me, I just couldn't get them to see in to me past the egg surrounding me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"The Handmaiden of Berrybooth Hollow. Berrybooth is the town--oh this part's a tranlator's note and it's long. Mava haunted the bar most persistenty, as her orders from the Princess were to find out everything (more rightly, every<i>one</i>) interesting about Berrybooth there was to do before the family landed. Her picket-boat with its time-strange enchantment was fast enough to take her there, pick up the news from the locals, make it seem as if she hadn't left the royal yacht in the first place, and come back where she had departed from and change back from commoner and friend into the Princess and her handmaiden (a very special handmaiden, but a handmaiden anyway, that was part of the fun of it), and pretend they had been in her cabin having sex the whole time--the last part was true, if you left the adventure out. Ironic to think there were countries they'd been to where the adventure would have seemed innocent and the sex been scandalous!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"The news in Berrybooth was interesting if you were a military strategist, which made the Princess stop listening instantly. Wasn't there anything <i>interesting? </i>How about this story they were telling in the back there? Mava, go sneak up so I can listen through you, she thought at her friend (the Princess was loud as a bear with wood shoes, but Mava could sneak like a mouse wearing slippers of cotton)."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"The story was some kind of dream about watching events far away in a thing called the Stormglobe. They had to be things that would tear your whole world apart so most couldn't see anything, but occasionally you saw something that saved you and your family and everyone you cared about. It was called the Stormglobe because it showed you a storm coming if you had one. It was in the caverns beneath Berrybooth lighthouse, supposedly, which the friend this common--blacksmith, by the look of him--was telling the story to thought was ridiculous, those rocks were as solid as his companion's thick head!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Mama keeps reading silently for a minute, looking amused, and then closes the book and puts it on the table beyond her waffles, and gets back to eating--good idea. Waffles, cocksleeve! I find that I've been clutching my crown with both hands while she reads, and set it aside.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The silliness of the order makes me grin--ooh, waffles from up on the table where you were before.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"The Princess is heartforming! She and Mava are naked like me and Lyra! I can see why this one is marked!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Poing up to feed you sit on my heels with my hands down in between where my legs are spread wide to give a nice view while I'm feeding you. Ready with fork when you look for it....</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Me too, Boobsqueeze. I read further on, and this story's delightful."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Lyra keeps feeding me waffles whenever I want them, and toast and the drink that's like milk with some kind of buttery spice, and I think about those first moments of the game taking control of me aboard Isht Visht.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Mama, how did you know my hometown was Stamford? Hadn't you not met my parents yet?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"That's an intersting answer to give, because it wasn't this me who asked you those questions! You had your eyes closed, during all of that questioning, until you opened your eyes inside amber, to prevent you from seeing a much older me come and talk to you about what had happened to you in Limbo. I visited us by time-travel! I still don't know why, but it could only be me, or the Dreams wouldn't have let her come in there. She asked you those questions and I listened to answers that very surprised me! I wouldn't have known I should ask then, that must be why it was necessary, and it did help me wonder who I had actually captured! That was the moment I started thinking the prophecy might be about you. Listening to you and my Klapta play with the prophecy and solve every bit of it easily was a very strange time, but if I hadn't been there in the nursery I think I might not have dared to just call you my girlfriend. I guess that's another reason to visit my past like that, but I was surprised let me tell you!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Is that kind of thing common, like, is time travel hard? Obviously I'm wrong but in my understanding it's impossible even in a world where all--this--is as everyday as it seems here."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I guesture around, then lay my hand on Lyra's knee.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Time travel is obviously possible, and timelike existence makes it seem like it's happening all the time in some people's eyes, but what I did to come visit myself is not very common or easy. You have to be just right in using it, or you won't be able to touch anything when you get where you meant to, if you go where you mean to in the first place! Time is like a river with ice packs, and things can fit into the cracks if you position them carefully, but the ice is impenetrable solid. We must have cracks all around us, for what we've been seeing to be possible! I wonder what caused that?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Guinan said she was a Time Lord, but she's like...the Dreams told me she's like Santa Claus, it'd be mean if she wasn't real so the Dreams made her out of people's wishes, so I could see how being a Time Lord is just the thing that explains everything about her character on TNG. Could she have something to do with this?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I don't think it was Guian. Her kind of being don't do things like we've been experiencing. They come for things like making you smile to have her sneak up on you in Ten Forward, and go to the next moment they can enjoy like that. The most right explanation I see is it you, me, Isht Visht and Lyra, helping ourselves from far down time. That explains why the prophecy only makes sense to the four of us, why your crown knew exactly when to float up to me, and why I came to visit us in the nursery."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"We're Bill-and-Ted-ing--wait, wasn't there something about Bill and Ted in the prophecy, or we interpreted it that way or something before? Or do you guys think we should just go through it top to bottom like the last time now that Mama's here? I'm getting confused Mama, what do you think?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I give Mama my best stupid hopeful guide-me look with a bitten lip at the end of the sentence, and her face lights up--more of that please!&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Okay but <i>really, </i>it's really not making stupider? This is really just that it's refreshing to just ditz out sometimes? Because it <i>is!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: I'm keeping my average intelligence, but the highs are higher now, and the lows...are a lot of fun. By not driving myself constantly, my mind can do bursts that were too hard for me in the past.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Well Pussywillow, it might be nice to go over all of it, if you think you can wait that long for stories! How does your head feel? Are you too horny? You look about to pounce on Lyra, but I think you just see your heartchild. Why don't we try to begin it, and see how far through we make it? I think we should start with your Bill and Ted thought, and go until it doesn't feel fun. That's what kind of prophecy I would make!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"That would be awesome! Yes, I'm pretty horny--"&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I give myself a little squeeze with my free hand to remind myself not to push the wonderful feeling away, and it's great, but my mind keeps hungering.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"--but I'm horny to know what the fuck is <i>going on </i>Mama everything is so confusing! Before we start...did you guys start remembering like a whole alternate history of Earth sometime while Lyra and I were flying in the Waifu? I think you said something about that or knowing all about fixing Freddie but it's all kind of blurred but I think I was like mostly breasts at that point--no you did too Isht Visht! Yes that was us if so, but...what happened for you guys?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy looks feed waffle. Syrupy oops!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">There's going to be licking to do later, isn't there, cocksleeve.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Cleaning tongue is ready Mommy!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">That's not necessarily the one I want...</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"We had an interesting journey, didn't we, Klapta? Right before we landed, I sat down with a weird sense of confusion. Isht Visht rocked very strangely, and we both felt deja vu at the same time. It must have been you two changing our history, because now I remember a new one where you called me from something called dreamtalking class--I was helping you learn how to hear Lyra! You were only eleven, sweet boobsqueeze, and she was already physical! What did you do to Earth's history, you and your cocksleeve?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Mommy I think I might know why it seems like we keep getting so many things happening like breaking that hole in the stairway! You got really mad every time with the angel and Eden's computer and stabbing Earth up. Maybe your anger is so strong it makes cracks in time because of how you had parts all over history like with seeing Freddie? Rada that makes sense, right?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Wow smart cocksleeve be proud.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"That kind of pain-work must have made you feel terrible, Pussylick! No wonder the game kept pushing you to complete it as fast as you could! It makes sense if you can put your consciousness into the shape for it. Humans don't do things like that easily, but pain makes us stuck in the time when it happened sometimes."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Honestly Mama it just like I keep finding I have more fingers that've been stuck in car doors forever and I keep getting them out by vaporizing the planet the car is on. And I don't know what we did to history!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Weepiness cuts through my voice, and she throws down her knife and fork and grabs me into a hug. Her thing of being bigger than me even though I'm twice her size is on full blast.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">When the sob has calmed, she squeezes me and goes back to eating. Big drink of milk, cocksleeve.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Let's get started doing the prophecy. If you're right, Pussywillow, it probably tells us exactly what we've been wondering. Klapta, light up that vision!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The monolith appears on the table in front of us again. Cocksleeve, your memory will do you for this, right? Seeing won't help?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes Mommy I can see it already in my memory. Remember I see your eyes too!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Yes, but I might spend too much time looking right <i>here.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Blush so much nectar outside me I'm making a mess on the table!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">It's giving me all sorts of appetities...</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">That makes me horny eep even more drips if I keep looking see monolith in my mind's eye.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Numbers appear on the monument like the last time.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Where shall we start, boobsqueeze? Bill and Ted, or the next part after the full refund?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I scan the prophecy, feel lost.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I could swear we had something about Bill and Ted in the hall before--before out first date Mama. Cocksleeve, do you remember?" And chime in if you think of stuff!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Mommy you didn't say the prophecy made you think about Bill and Ted but there was right before Isht Visht said her hallways had dramatically variable length where you were like 'I thought this was a totally long hall' and you thought about totally deep hole, could that be what you think--Mommy I see you yes it's that. That was right after v one of p four."</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW"><i>2. On the last day of Edensong, a child whose name is blue eyes' will shine out a light that touches every last part of the network of soulsand.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Alright, that doesn't seem applicable? I just got rid of Blu'eyes."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I see us in there perfectly! That's you right before you stabbed Earth everywhere. Soulsand are blocks in a game from the 2010s called Minecraft that have screaming sad faces all over them. Didn't you say you struck everywhere someone reached for their seedling without getting their hand on it? That's sad screaming in my eyes! It was defintely the last day of the universe Eden created to our eyes, and your name did still have Blu'eyes as your second name then, so I think that's you stabbing Earth out now. You touched every part, I watched you. You didn't leave one single screaming sad face, not even that last one. Let's see the next line!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW"><i>3. It will slash through the aether and burn out the final remote space like cycles are breaking.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I thought the word--hey weird. Game isn't a--" <i>Slip.</i>&nbsp;"Um...I forget if I've said my game doesn't let me use big words to--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">This is that wicked determined expression I see you get while I fuck you sometimes, isn't it, cocksleeve!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"--make myself seem like a grown up," I mumble at Mama with horny embarrassment, determined to get the most flirting out of it I can. She's hard to read but I <i>think</i> she liked it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"--and I totally thought um it's the other word for like air or sky that's not wind,"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Waitaminute. Am I right about exactly how 'mean' you're being, game? Could I not do it before because I didn't think it was <i>fun?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"aeth--" Heartbeat, face hot. "--ther."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Bitch, </i>I smile at the game.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"But I didn't do it like that it was just like part of my internal monologue which isn't the word I'd use anyway so I'm guessing my game maybe nudged me a little in which case that's significant but like, isn't this just describes what happened more? No, wait, I didn't burn anything out, that's what I was telling you before Mama, you showed me Earth so I wouldn't actually want to burn it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"That seems like it might be about Eden's control room--no that can't be, aether specifically makes it about when you stabbed Earth out. Klapta what's that make you see?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Lucy what did you exactly think? Sis you remember, right?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Mommy you said 'aether' four times in you mind's voice. In the egg you said <b>Light streams out from me visible even in the aether that fills the egg</b> that was in the egg that's actually the family exploding room, then you said&nbsp;<b>Lyra's mind is carrying us into the aether</b>, and THEN you said&nbsp;<b>sending fragments of Earth spinning into the aether </b>and that was it from the exploding room but before that when sis was a kiteship and Rada threw rope out you said&nbsp;<b>I'm calling this aether because there keeps being air in it</b>&nbsp;about the void of the True Sea."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Swirly cheap coffee creamer, I didn't notice any of those! Good cocksleeve--you guys can you explain the breakfast swearing soon? Is it just funny? Because it's hilarious."</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Captain Crunch is wavin' farewell! Okay huge context and you guys have to trust me. There's this band you NEED to see, but you'l be like LAME if you hear me describe it, so I want you to just listen first. Please Captain? Like actually a show? When we have any idea what's happening--and like I guess if your games let you and Lucy though I mean look at sis, they MUST."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Klapta is very excited about the band we got this exclaimation way out of. We can go see the band when we all feel settled enough to explore. Maybe that can be our first expedition as a family! Now boobsqueeze, that seems like a lot of exceptions! Do they make a pattern in your eyes?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">This must be one of those higher highs--or maybe I'm just proud of myself. Is there a way to make self-satisfaction cute? Anyway!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Um, you guys I think it's a new part of the prophecy. Slash through the aether, like how you put slashes at the ends of lines in poems, look--Dreams I wish for a black mirror."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">They don't respond, but Isht Visht does:</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"It's like this, right?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">Light streams out from me visible even in the aether that fills the egg</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">Lyra's mind is carrying us into the aether<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">sending fragments of Earth spinning into the aether<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">I'm calling this aether because there keeps being air in it<b><br></b></p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Klapta that's brilliant--I mean all of you cocksleeves, good work! Now burn out the final remote space by take aether out everywhere it ends a line! aether is space in Lucy's eyes, that keeps having air in it, and we all know the element air is mental things in the system we were using then!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Check it:"</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">Light streams out from me visible even in the aether that fills the egg</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">Lyra's mind is carrying us into the<br></p>

<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">I'm calling this aether because there keeps being air in it<b><br></b></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"That's you being mad about not finishing sentences, cocksleeve, with the radio beacon!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes Mommy and then it changed and I thought it was so fast I couldn't see the beginning or ends. Where was that leading us, did we ever get there? Is our house what it pointed at?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Isht Visht squish them together and get rid of the extra <i>the's!"</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Oh, sweet! Yeah that like says something!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">Light streams out from me visible even in the aether that fills the egg&nbsp;Lyra's mind is carrying us into&nbsp;sending fragments of Earth spinning into&nbsp;I'm calling this aether because there keeps being air in it</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"That almost sounds like the voice we heard, Klapta! Write it out for them next to this! Boobsqueeze and Lyra we heard a voice saying strange things <i>over and over again Klapta </i>write it out on the double sailor!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Aye Captain!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">Light streams out from me visible even in the aether that fills the egg&nbsp;Lyra's mind is carrying us into&nbsp;sending fragments of Earth spinning into&nbsp;I'm calling this aether because there keeps being air in it</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">Up a down staircase into the parlor and out of the rainbow. What kind of mockingbird am I? Call the outerside window murderplace, because I'm not only faster I'm <i>better</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Mommy that's shareware! You see it right Mommy?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Oh my fucking god I can't believe I can read that good cocksleeve! <i>Light streams out from me visible even in the aether </i>that's the hyperdrive in <i>Stella Obscura </i>which also describes this<i>&nbsp;</i>because even <i>I </i>think this is obscure, and then <i>filling the egg Lyra mind is carrying us into </i>that's the jumpgate in <i>Stella Obscura</i>&nbsp;which is Latin for <i>Black Star</i>&nbsp;and Lyra has black stars but <i>also </i>the egg in Glypha which Isht Visht is just Joust with prettier graphics then fragments of earth spinning into the aether that'll be Maelstrom which Isht Visht is Asteroids, and then <i>keeps being air in it / up a down staircase into the parlor </i>damn cockslseeve, that's obscure, those are level names from Glider, then <i>out of the rainbow...oh! </i>Off Mac games now. Because rainbow apple. Umm...I have no idea, and I think that's the point. Heartbreakingly gorgeous family?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Mocking bird is totally the last book of Hunger Games which is called Mockinjay. It's a young adult series Lucy and Lyra about like this dystopian society where...yeah that narrows it down self anyway we're just getting the references right? I'm stuck after that though."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Deja vu! Outerside window murderplace, it's a murder mystery and remember it had the little Exits window cocksleeve? It's another obscure game...and then alright you guys must know the <i>Tron</i>&nbsp;reference!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Alright but what does any of this mean, though. Can you guys explain your references? I'll write 'em down just keep going!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"So...going through hyperspace between levels of OH MY FUCK Stella Obscura is a rail shooter like StarFox why'd I never notice that its gimmick is even being 3D! Okay one level of StarFox to the next. Through a portal or gate thing (which one of the visions we saw fixing Freddie was a portal leading out of Earth while it was ending, into you, Isht Visht). Black star carrying us into an egg from which your ride hatches...no, no, Lyra's mind. She's like you and you're the only bigger nerd than her I've even heard of <i>if </i>you even are I haven't got to really explore that part of her yet ANYWAY The first part is self referential, it literally means going through obscure references to get to the next level. So <i>then </i>egg your ride hatches from, asteroids which is about blowing up rocks we're back to the exploding room, glider is a game about riding air currents until you fly out the window at the end of the game...and then suddenly a different world I guess? What's with Mockingjay? But then calling up a list of exits like in a text adventure but as a window you can click on and <i>cycles are breaking </i>like how Flynn got out into the grid in Tron through the hole in the game wall the lightcycle broke!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Isht Visht scribbles and revises furiously in the air beside the monolith as I valley-girl at her, and we end up with:</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">Obscure references portals to next Game (StarFox=game after that intro) level,&nbsp;Egg ride hatches from,&nbsp;exploding room, riding air to keep going until you fly out the window and beat the game, using the game world against itself to break the fourth wall and wreck the game, calling up exits list (visual), escape through a hole someone else made into the real world outside the game arena.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I don't want to wreck our game! I need it!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Fuck. That was going to be <i>love it</i>. Still true oh god.</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Lucy I get you you're game's just your heartformer to you, yeah? I don't think this means that, it's okay!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Tears that would be easy to keep back well to tell me, I think, I feel seen and cared about. Isht Visht's voice is deadly serious and comforting as if to say <i>of course you should be scared what a horrible idea...</i>and her reaction to my sending Lyra a room away before comes to mind, and and and she's totally right. If you wanted me to understand you, cocksleeve, it's working.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy I think Isht Visht is right it can't be part of my game to wreck it because yes Mommy you need a keeper and my made my game to help you understand how I feel about you. Be okay Mommy I need you!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I clap my hands onto both of her thighs and squeeze tight, making sure to catch the a loop of the leash and dig it into her thigh with my hand next to my eravahk...apparently the game's taught me by now that sometimes the kindest thing you can do is make it hurt.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Haah oof please keep crushing me Mommy it feels good to be held so tight!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I know what you mean.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"You guys...don't think she and me are the least bit over the top with this, do you?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I certainly hope not, since I feel the same way about Isht Visht! Remeber, Klapta, you might keep your heartchild close by leashing her, but mine was my house that I lived in for most of our relationship! I would feel very upset to think of her not being near me, even for seconds like in that scene you were planning! It's not like the relationship humans have with each other. I won't be so sad I can't breathe when our alone time comes next not to have you beside me (I'll miss you, I promise, just not that way). If we had alone time from our seedlings, do you think we could get anything out of it? I know I couldn't! They're made to be like part of your body, or maybe you're part of theirs. How would you feel about leaving your kidney in the next room for a day? To have people talk about that casually is terrifying! Please don't say that kind of thing anymore, Pussywillow, I saw on your face then and now it upset you just as much as I'm saying it upsets me and my Klapta."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I'm so sorry to all of you. Okay. God damn I feel so understood in this family. You know guys might try the leash thing, if you're living in a house now--I guess you probably have in all your time, huh."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I don't think it's your fault, Mommy. I blame Eden because you learned from it that losing companions is something that just always happens and you can't be too upset."</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Somebody should stab that bitch and burn its house down."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Boobsqueeze I agree with our seedlings. Let's keep doing the prophecy!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Okay how did we get onto this by asking just what's happening and the answer is this."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"How does this answer what's happening? Our question wasn't specific because I think we all hoped the prophecy would just say what we needed to hear next. That's how I thought."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">My mind races--omifuck, the game wasn't kidding! I can feel like a hunger building up with time and exertion. I'm going to be such a stupid bimbo later. It's going to <i>rule</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Not now though. I scan Isht Visht's notes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"So, by doing all this prophecy stuff, like I'm really getting that we're letting people or me or something into Limbo, which--wait, fuck! Am I not feeling myself up enough or what? Cocksleeve, what about the whole VR angle with Stella Obscura! Isht Visht I don't know how this fits in but it seems significant with the rest of the stuff about exits and breaking the fourth wall and stuff...Stella Obscura--I mean, do you know it?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Um, obscure Mac games from the early 90s? Nah, not an interest. Wait Lucy holy fuck did you forget what the Soft Dorothoy logo is?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">She displays for a moment the 1-bit dithered sexy topless...fairy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Most of the games are Soft Dorothy. What if this about you, Lucy? What if like, what's going on is we've been working on you and Lyra escaping Earth all this time? Right? Like all that stuff is what happened with you, just like you said, and you're obviously already here with us but the time loop fuckery means we had to go blow Earth up with you so you could let yourself out. Like, we know that though, don't we? <i>I </i>thought the question you were asking was like, why can we remember two histories, and why are these prophecies and time-travelling stuff happening all around us?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"It sounds to me Boobsqueeze like you made way to get out for yourself, included us in it, wrecked Earth in the process, made lots of strange things happen with time-travel because time was broken around you because someone else played their game carelessly, showed yourself the way out from the time in the exploding room we just experienced, and now here you are with us! That would explain everything, I think! We're not so surprised because we're wise enough to see some of what's happening, that's how I see it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Mama you're right! I had one more weird internal monologue thing that must have been my game messing with me. When the exploding room opened after I was done, um, exploding, I called the exit a window to myself even though that makes no sense. This...message or whatever says you keep riding the air until it carries you out the window and you beat the game. That's you supporting me, Mama, like you have been this whole way. Oh my fuck, please let that mean we did it and we can just relax and hang out now!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Pussywillow..."</p>
