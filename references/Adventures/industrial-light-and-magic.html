<article class="chapter 85---industrial-light-and-magic">
    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">85 - Industrial Light and Magic</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Dreams I don't think I can do it. It's still so hard to believe I'm closing the timeloop here and not breaking it.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They show me Bugs Bunny and I sigh so deeply--SkyLab!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">No, wait, the astronauts on SkyLab went on strike for a day because they were overscheduled.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We're in a spaceship. This is a <i>break</i>&nbsp;from closing the timeloop, to tell me Christmas stories so I don't go crazy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A toystore filled with zillions of Legos and other fun things.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Please Princess can we play with the Legos some?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My face crumples into sobbing. YES, I want to scream, but however tiny the chance is we can't possibly miss this if there is any <i>slight </i>hope of breaking Earth open without that--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A nurse hat--oh. Tears overwhelm me and the Dreams put a landscape of Lego knobs in my third eye.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">What will happen to me here? Will we disappear?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A bass guitar but on top where the head should be is a mug with a puzzle-piece shape out of it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The mug is a pun my face missing pieces. This is like our base, I guess? To do these things from. So we'll stay? Dreams I <i>know</i>&nbsp;but I feel somehow on verge of wrecking all of this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now a violin, played passionately but carefully, with porcelain handles at the head. Seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">It means holding you carefully to play you into doing this and they see that you're fragile and aren't dropping you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Even more tears--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My Care Bears outfit again, the rainbow comes alive, the procession of Smurfs, the doorknob is in my hand.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I wish for the Stamford where Mama's just been educating my parents and all those fun things are waiting, bring Boobsong with me in that, and swing the door wide, and the journey breaks, and I'm back in the whaleship with Boobsong.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I sob and clutch Boobsong as the visions come, full of that same helpless feeling as before my light came back.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--Boobsong in the kitchen in stamford carrying a huge and very perfect stack of pancakes to the table with a pat of butter on top and syrup dripping over them. She's an <i>artist</i>, makes her food look the perfect way food does in commercials. I'm sitting in my spot and she leans low with her boobs squeezed between her arms to set the pancakes on the table in the middle, looks at me flirting and wiggles, I watch her like there's nothing else in the universe. My dad comes in and she straightens in a bubble-pop--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--now she's coming over with a plate or tray or something with glasses held high like a waitress it's dark in the breakfast nook but the lights are on in the kitchen. She gets to me and kneels low so I can get my glass, no of course she's handing it to the table am I already game-controlled that far how did we go so <i>fast</i>&nbsp;with that--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--Boobsong holding our other cat Cotton, standing by the wall behind my spot at the table, nuzzling her and looking thrilled, cats make her <i>happy</i>&nbsp;this is adorable she's chanting some silly little song at Cotton who looks like she might possibly even <i>like </i>this which would be the first thing Cotton's liked that year at least--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--on the living room couch wrapped up in one of Isht Visht's Starfleet sheets with Boobsong watching How The Grinch Stole Christmas with the family (we seem not to have found me clothes yet) and her polyphonic little voice is&nbsp;<i>so cute</i>&nbsp;blaring <i>da-who-do-re </i>along with the Who she's got my mom singing in <i>seconds </i>(and me faster than that) after which only the worst person in the world doesn't join in but they didn't show up tonight--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--Boobsong very carefully filling glasses of eggnog with precisely-placed nutmeg so they'll all be the same height of eggnog on her tray, eyes level with the glasses and carton over her head to pour, seen across the prep table in the kitchen from me where I stand watching her, warm with delight at her cute performance of getting them <i>just so</i>--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I twist away from the visions, crying. They're so beautiful, but, I can't, it hurts too much--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Princess dress, stage lights. Yeah, goddamn right. I was the fucking <i>Starlight Princess</i>&nbsp;and it got erased <i>again </i>like Eden is some kind of petulant little kid I'm writing with who erases the whole story every time anyone gets happy because it thinks REAL STORIES for GROWNUPS are all about DEATH AND SUFFERING AND NOTHING EVER BEING GOOD! Damn right I'm cracking to have to do anything but wipe the crater Eden made out of me away and just leave Earth behind.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My game suddenly brings up the memory of that same blandly not-me house of my dad's family and this pops me into the journey or vision or whatever this exactly is a place that's not here physically but which I percieve. It looks slightly newer and nicer in my third eye--wait this is different--it's like a funeral home or something? Or evangelical church? There's party-stuff, streamers around and stuff, someone has a ladder. What is this? It feels like a memory returning but it's not grim and sad like I thought.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Vision of a giant purple flower and bright white flower shaped kind of like projectors shine light out. Me and Boobsong are projecting here--she's still hugged to me where I stood with her but that's also our arrangement in this place--but what's here and why and why in response to me not being able to stand the memories?&nbsp;I know I should let them come but it hurts too much to think of that beautiful cathedral just vaporized!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A bright-lit stage. I must have rebuilt my fame using my light-powers--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A rainbow-glowing wrecking ball crane, and then the Berlin Wall being knocked down?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Somehow I find a way to cry harder. Dreams show me. Don't imply it show me. If that's true show me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A vision of...exactly the journey we're in, like they're trying to say <i>look, silly.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">At one end of the room a jumpsuited workman is doing something with blinding-bright light-bars in rainbow colors that flank a huge hentai Boobsong. The wall behind them is black to make the colors and--that's really good, it could almost be a picture of your real hentai mode!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I look around the space, turning Boobsong with me. Brick wainscoating below, retina-searing blocks of RGB above on the white walls: screens, in test mode.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This was some kind of evangelical church or funeral thing or something, it's in pieces now with astroturf rolled and randomly and props of fake bricks being made ready to be moved out, but...snif...they're setting it up for live dreamskin making, and that's a <i>lot </i>of tech. We never had screens that bright in the Strawberry Temple!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This is good stuff but this went up in hours, I can tell. They're redeploying like a fucking invasion force. That's your point, isn't it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Look at the sides of the space, see how it's coming apart? They built this like a movie set, or a TV show, either way it's not just a place in some&nbsp; country town where a church rented out their hall to make hurrying dreamskin making. Look outside let's see what's out there!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Yeah, good idea. Both ends of the space are covered with black curtains and there doesn't seem to be any other door, so I shuffle a ways with Boobsong and then stick her beside me holding my hand and make for the curtain at the other end from her image. Through it--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">How...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We're in the middle of an astroturfed, roped-off open space, with the rides and castle of Disneyworld looming not so far off. It's dusk, and we're someplace central, there's even a Goofy goofing over there beyond the ropes. No wonder the tech was so fancy! Either it's the future or there must have been half a million dollars worth of LEDs in there. So what's with the fake-cheap pseudo-evangelical thing?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Wait a minute, coming apart...that giant hentai Boobsong was great and maybe I'll get like fifty of them for Heart Home but...I'd do that because it's silly (yeah, Boobsong army in the garden with the glowy plants!). That setup with light-bars and a cutout would have flown at a county fair, but this is <i>Disneyland. </i>If Boobsong and me had <i>any </i>input on this we're <i>up to something.</i> I squidge us between the fence around the building and the wall and follow along outside the walls, find a seam, squat to look at the footings.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Kneel with Princess curious.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Endless rainbow twizzlers."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's a temporary guard-fence all along the edges, because the walls extend down into a pit of <i>ride mechanism</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This was everything Disney played chicken with a seed-ghost <i>not </i>to do, and now they're rushing to build us a whole ride, right in pride of place by the castle? Boobsong what's going on here?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I peer in, trying to see if I can figure out what the ride does (beyond maybe the long hall actually being a ride tunnel), but it's too dark.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">It looks like they changed their mind super hard!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We were like, eighteen at that breakfast, though. There was no little kid me to hook them!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Gaasp that's right they had to know you <b>starting</b> as the sexy Princess Starlight! Why is it different now?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Good question. Can you ponify in journey but not the real world?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes. Just let me have my hand so I can use it to turn into a hoof please!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">hhaaaah change! Pony up hehe Princess I'm ready climb on me let's see what this is!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My pony! I'm always surprised how happy this makes me. Hop on you. Yah! Fly!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Wings ready spring hyah!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The "church" is in the middle of a big oval of astroturf. It looks hastily put up--there are wrinkles everywhere. There are construction this and that all around, an octagonal umbrella, not too much to explain things.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Flying my kinky pegasus into the sky at sunset at Disneyworld is kind of magical, though. I wheel her all around slowly to take in the view.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The flatland of Orlando manages to be pretty in the night air anyway, the rides look cool in the night (the park seems to be staying open late), even the huge Mickey holding up the even more huge flagpole with smaller characters around his feet manages to look magical with the lights shining up at him--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"What. But I thought--fly down there!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Gaaaasp how Princess how can the be possible all that stuff got erased didn't it?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">One of the characters is a four year old blonde girl in a black princess dress with rainbow stockings and a big sparkly bow in her hair and her grinning hammer friend held high.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Why were you always a hammer, anyway? Can you remember? Was that just Disney being silly?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The journey breaks, and we're back on the Whaleship, hugging, standing where we were.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">I'm your companion who's extremely useful and what's more useful in cartoons than a hammer? Remember how fun it was? We didn't have a serious show. Everything was super silly fun time.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Shaking with laughter: Like maybe just a tiny bit. Of course our show was like that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Dreams let's do this come on!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">If the answers are anyplace it'll be in these memories.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess remember how big you are that's the way to remember these! The Dreams aren't holding them, you are!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Disney built us a ride. In a hurry.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--we're in the 'temple' from the journey, Boobsong is facing away from me dancing and bouncing in front of one of the screens. The place is more finished and is cheesy cheap Bland Nonspecific Chapel as only Disney can hy-per-realize it. Nobody else is in here and I'm as naked as Boobsong, not even rainbow socks (okay now this is <i>really</i>&nbsp;impossible). The screens are on are some kind of game--I'm not playing, just watching Boobsong try it out and checking out the space. The end of the chapel is just a plastic curtain with a split down the middle and printed with a picture of a sort of fake fireplace with plants end-piece to go with the cheesy decor. Everything is really affectedly fake and bad in Disney's expensive way. There's another one of the curtains at the other end as I turn around, beautiful hentai Boobsong and the light bars are covered--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--looking up with night air all exciting at a huge video screen showing me sleeping facedown on some stupidly poofy white bed. I roll over to reveal Boobsong hugged in my arms, and glows with the unreal saturation of laser-light illuminate each rainbow-sheening segment of the cathedral with its row of oval windows for a moment as it rises out of the lawn to build back from the video screen one rainbow color at a time around the audience who've just been revealed by the retracting chapels. I'm poised with Boobsong on the launch platform, covered in a black cloth so we won't be obvious, she's in pony form and ready to fly. The cloth is whipped off us: now! On the screen, we "wake up" and bound out of bed and out of view just as we flap into the air to have the forming cathedral lock into place around us as we make for the stage below the video screen--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--on the stage with Boobsong, the crowd huge, they're applauding which I never allowed in the Strawberry Temple but here seems different somehow. People have thrown flowers and things on the stage which makes me ambivalent because my inner attention whore is about to cum while my heartforming muse approves of doing anything that draws you into the fantasy more and my actual heartformer is going <i>hey, don't throw that to us, give them to the seedling you just implanted if I've done anything at all right, well okay except the purple flowers Boobsong has earned every one of those--</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Melting pixie stix pancake batter. We were <i>bigger than last time. How</i>? On the screen we barely look eightteen, how could we get from rebooted to this in--how old are we on reboot day? Could you tell, Acme Station?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Acme Station remembers it perfectly at least that much and it was two fourteen AM November twenty-second nineteen ninety-seven so you were eighteen.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">So a year <i>maybe</i>. How'd we get our statue back?&nbsp;Dreams?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We're back in one of the Generic Chapels of our ride at Disneyland in journey again. Something is on a new screen at the end. It's the president, giving a speech in front of his blue curtain at the white house. I lead us up to see what's going on, and I can hear his voice:</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"This early morning, our contry experienced what many are calling the undoing--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I pull Boobsong to my side to watch. There's some kind of stir in the room he sharp-looks into silence.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"--of our great country's great republic. I come before you now, still as your president, with full power of authority as the commander in chief of our armed forces, with senate and congress in session at this moment and the judicial branch ready and waiting to safeguard the constituion I and the members of this government are sworn to uphold, to tell you, <i>poppycock!"</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Four short hours ago, the skies opened and thousands of years of myth and legends became reality. What did we find. Not invasion from the stars. No judgement or wrath upon us. Friendship, was what greeted me on the Whitehouse lawn this morning. It greeted all of us, in our homes, at our jobs, on the street as we were walking. In a single moment, our universe that was all we had known became part of something much bigger and stranger than we could have imagined."</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Fate has been kind to us in giving us this chance to see with our own eyes the messengers of Heaven on Earth this morning."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Great gooey strawberry cane tops, what's that sound in the press conference like a whirring explosion in slow motion? I know that sound, that's--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">That's Rarity's walker!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>This</i>&nbsp;will be good. Please <i>please</i>&nbsp;let Mama be standing on her&nbsp;Soefta'xrn-ian&nbsp;cultural heritage I want to see the look on his face.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"It is with honor now I introduce a representative of the world that greets us, one to whom in an ironic twist I found myself directed when it became my place to say that classic declaration of peaceful intention, the phrase countless movies and TV shows said time and time again when aliens landed bearing not arms but the open hand of friendship and invitation to join galactic society, take me to your leader."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Camera flashes make the scene glitter, and he turns to stage right to greet someone. He reaches out his hand to shake theirs--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"<b>WHAT?!! </b>How did we get there even it takes like five hours to drive did they fly us even so it would take like two hours and you had to meet me <b>and</b> have sex <b>and</b> get everything explained <b>and</b> be able to think after all that stuff happened <b>and</b> know what to say for this! Princess how is this possible it can't be!</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Rainbows have several meanings here in America. This morning I invoke to you God's promise in Exodus not to ever again destroy the people of this planet in a global cataclysm as the representative of our benefactors from beyond the sky arrives dressed in their colors. Princess Lucy Starlight of the Strawberry Empire, welcome to Washington DC. In another strange twist, I have no reason to say welcome to Earth, or even America, because according to our own secretary of state, she is born and raised an American citizen."<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"What."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's me alright, in my Princess Starlight outfit, walking on camera with Boobsong hanging onto my hand in full view of everyone, naked as she always is.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"<i>What</i>."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I have my full makeup on and everything. Rarity's walker must have hyperdrive&nbsp;<i>and</i>&nbsp;a hair salon--alright that checks out actually.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">In the journey, Boobsong bouncing at my side with excitement, while onscreen she follows me quietly up to stand behind and to the right of me as I walk to the podium and get ready to speechify.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Game this is you, right? You're puppeting and either you or Mama or someone with ANY SLIGHT IDEA WHAT THEY'RE DOING came up with this? Why&nbsp;<i>me</i>, anyway!? This should be Mama or somebody from TRAIN!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: everyone helped me prepare for this, but only my own mind is controlling me here.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i><b>WHAT!?</b>&nbsp;</i>THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm starting:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"They come in peace. I'd say&nbsp;<i>we</i>&nbsp;come in peace, but I was in my bed in Stamford Connecticut when everything started happening. Just like he said, I was born and raised here in America, and I'll always have Maine in my bloodstream. Our state fruit is Strawberries, for those of you From Away as we like to say it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Wait, huh? Game PAUSE.</p>
<p data-voice-id="v5MELBxAO">- PAUSE -</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Everything freezes and we're Paused. I can see, this time, but not move--bwahahaha we're&nbsp;<i>anime</i>&nbsp;so we can pause like a tape here!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Boobsong isn't Maine's state fruit&nbsp;<i>blueberries&nbsp;</i>OH MY SWEET TURBOWHIPPED COTTON CANDY IT GOT BLUE-IZED. THE FUCKING&nbsp;<b>STATE FRUIT.&nbsp;</b>WHO DO I BURN SHOW ME DREAMS! HOW DARE YOU ERASE ME YOU PIECE OF SHIT--GAME YOU SAID I COULD GO EDEN-HUNTING LET'S GO--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me Santa Claus coming down a very Heart Home chimney. They have a present for me? Ooh is it Unicron-looking and will make a pretty explosion?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Bugs Bunny overlays the Santa.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>But I'm still so angry, </i>I imagined-sob pathetically.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Fire in a fireplace. How can Santa come if the fire is lit?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I CAN'T JUST <i>PUT IT OUT </i>MY HEART DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">An EXIT sign. We're still doing that. Put it aside for whatever my version of the courtyard for Earth now is going to be.</p>
<p data-voice-id="v5MELBxAO">- UNPAUSE -</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Everything starts moving, and I keep talking up on the screen. I can barely hear what my onscreen self is saying through my tears:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Strawberries are the&nbsp;<i>national</i>&nbsp;berry of my family Empire, but it's gone now, or I changed it entirely, whichever way you want to see it. You'll be hearing a lot about me, because&nbsp;<i>apparently</i>&nbsp;I accidentally created this entire movement around the ideals my family built their dynasty on before their world ended and they came here to escape from it. Dragons and angry goddesses aren't that different from your nation's economy collapsing--there's still nothing left afterwards--so in my way, I'm just like you, the descendant of immigrants who came to America to have a fresh start in life in a land of opportunity--or maybe you&nbsp;<i>are</i>&nbsp;those immigrants, still doing what people have always come here for."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This&nbsp;<i>must</i>&nbsp;be my game or Mama or&nbsp;<i>something.&nbsp;</i>Never if I studied while ten billion Seas dried up and the salt blew away would I learn to craft bullshit this finely.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I'm just like you in another way, because all of this is a surprise to me. Five hours ago, I woke up to see the most beautiful creature I'd ever laid eyes on watching me, calling me Lucy to wake me. I knew my name instantly, even thought my birth certificate says another name, and I think a lot of you are experiencing similar things. I also knew, that the person I was looking at had been there my whole life, and the only thing that was different was I could see and hear and taste her where before she was something my heart knew and mind didn't know how to process. We both have Maine inside of us, because we grew up there together."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams themselves. You came up with this and dreamtalked it or something, right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A Golden Globe award. Yeah, if I had one handy I'd give it to you, but huh?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">That means you wrote this, Princess. How did you have time to you like to write stories but this is incredible it must haven taken you weeks to write!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">DUH, I'm time travelling! We're still in my bed in Stamford! This must have been me from&nbsp;<i>years</i>&nbsp;after!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I barely catch my other self continuing onscreen:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Lyra, come here and tell everyone how we knew spring was here in Presque Isle."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Squeezy bottlefizz candy, I was so scared I'd call her Boobsong on CNN--because that would have been awesome even if it did ruin everything.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She comes up to lean toward the microphone, snuggly on me like she always is.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"We would sit by the side of the road and smell Jonny Jump-ups rising out of the snow even before it was melted yet. That's why they're called Johnny Jump-ups, because they&nbsp;<b>spring</b>&nbsp;out the minute spring is here!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"These aren't an invasion force, or even visitors exploring. They're as American as you and I are, and they lived here in harmony with us before we could see them. You know who I'm talking about. These are the dreams that seemed more real than the other ones, the imaginary friends from our childhoods, the wishes our hearts make when we're sleeping or dare to dream of things ordinarily too incredible to hope for. They are made of our fantasies held together with love. The only thing here to worry about is daring to see just how wonderful the gift they have for each of us who's found their friend again is."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Now let me get to princessing. On behalf of the Princess Starlight Rainbow Club, we welcome these newly revealed companions and all of the rest of you to a world I'd say was beyond imagining, except imagination is how it got there."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Are you surprised? I'm supposed to be some kind of dignitary, not the teenaged star of a kids' show from outside this universe, aren't I? Well, you see, in that world they don't have a government, or anything like one, to send official diplomats or be the central authority to do what I'm doing now. What they have is celebrities, and when people from worlds of authority ask who the leader is, they point to the person most able to be a good eidolon of their world to them. This time it's me, and it's my job to tell you about their world. You can describe it in perfectly accurate detail and not tell the most important thing about it, because things exist in their world that can't be contained in a framework of reasoning. Only your heart can see things like I have to tell you about to say what their world is like, so instead of describing it, I'm going to read from a storybook."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That must be the cue, because onscreen Lyra turns into a big leatherbound book with silver covers, and I open her to the marked page and start reading:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Outside of time..."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">That's the book I make? That's beautiful! But how did we know I could do that? It&nbsp;<b>must</b>&nbsp;be time travel!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It really is--alright, maybe I did write this, if I worked that hard to get reading the Five Pointed Star to them that soon.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I look&nbsp;<i>right</i>&nbsp;reading it, which is to say I look like an awkward fifteen year old who's been thrust into a completely insane situation and am projecting equal parts Real Live Princess and that helplessness my mom gets sometimes, and it makes me look as harmless and guile-l-ess as a kids show character. My princess dress looks cute and my hair bow instead of a crown is perfect.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">...strawberry teething rings I'm a convincing ageplayer. If I didn't know this had to be my time-travelling self I'd believe I'm actually fifteen, not eighteen. No wonder Mama freaked out like that when she was saving me from boob overload.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">On screen, I finish the story, and hold the book off the podium, and Lyra returns to my side in demon-form. I'm keeping silent for a minute, face down like I'm praying. After a minute, I look up again.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"The name of that story is The Five Pointed Star. If you were listening carefully, you caught that I only read about&nbsp;<i>four</i>&nbsp;places. The fifth place is yours. What does your perfect place have in it? Are there houses, or nothing but beautiful forest everywhere? Make up your perfect place, imagine it, and when you get to the Four Dreams which we all will someday now that the skies are open, it'll be there, waiting for you, better than you could have possibly hoped for."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"On the flight over here, I had to have everyone pep-talk me because I can't understand how I'm possibly able to represent that to you. They said it's because I live here, I can understand this world enough to see where the color is missing. I think the color is missing everywhere! I know where I think it's missing most, though, or at least it was until this morning. It's these companions of ours. I thought Lyra was left behind in Presque Isle when my family moved from there to Boston (friends don't come with you when you move after all, why should imaginary ones be different?) and I&nbsp;<i>saw&nbsp;</i>her leaping onto a pizza box on my first Birthday living in our new house in Arlington Massachusetts and I thought I was just stupid. That hole in my life has been eating me for nine years, but can you imagine what it's been like for Lyra? If you ask me to represent life in the Four Dreams here on Earth, the first thing I'll do is make room for companions like Lyra, in who they are, by their cultural standards. Lyra's kind don't wear clothing. Some other companions do, but I'm not going be the one to tell her she has to dress like them after she's spent fifteen years denied her rightful place in society as an American citizen born here as much as I was. I think it's time we make some space in our world, and maybe think about who else might be feeling like her in this country. You don't have to be invisible, to be invisible. The color's missing from this country in an awful lot of places."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"The next thing I'll do is make sure the gates of paradise are open for everyone. Not tomorrow, not next year, not at the end of life when you move on from this world, here and now. Imagination is the key to them, because it's the key to heartforming, the thing that makes Lyra's people more than fantasies, and their people are paradise coming to say hello in the shape of our wishes. You don't have a companion? You will soon if I can do anything about it! Maybe you don't want one or you have someone no companion could displace. That's fine with me, and congratulations! I'm talking about the people like I was six hours before this, sad and thinking their destiny was dinner for one eternally. Just give me a stage to stand on with Lyra. Inspiration is the key to heartforming, and I think we can inspire if you let us. Maybe, if we're lucky, people have already found companions just by watching me talk with her at my side like this. I&nbsp;<i>know</i>&nbsp;I'm not the only princess out there. Don't you all want your handmaidens?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I'll end by saying thank you, to everyone who helped me prepare for this. It's a long way to travel from my bed in Stamford to the White House in five hours and I don't mean in miles. Mister President, it's been an honor. Thank you for having me here."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I walk off the stage, with Lyra behind me, the journey breaks and we're back on the Whaleship.</p>
