<article class="chapter 84---christmas-lights">
    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">84 - Christmas Lights</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The vision stays, seeming to get bigger as I look at it.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">If you want me to actually get Care Bear Stared you'll have to do something about all this ice and broken glass inside me, Dreams.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The rainbow goes full-color and the Care Bears animate and hop away from the scene and the rainbow zooms in to take up most of my view on a white void and under it is...a skillet with eggs frying? Huh?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now Boobsong, so beautiful I feel horny from her smiling presence, we have our hands on the doorknob together, counting to three, we turn the knob, the forcefield drops, the rainbow with its frying eggs comes back, comes up and fills the view and I smell them and toast and bacon. It's Boobsong cooking, but...this is the kitchen in Stamford!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now back to the rainbow, over Boobsong holding the skillet over her head (bare-handed of course). She turns and tail-swishes across the kitchen to the breakfast nook (really just the dining room we always ate in) toward the table. The whole family's there, I'm sitting in my same spot, she holds the pan for me to take an egg, then my dad, then around to my Earth-mom and brothers, puts the pan in the sink, comes next to me and is snuggly silky Boobsong and says something in my ear and I pull her onto my lap and hold her while she cuts egg for me. This is weirder than ever, she's naked but that seems to be of no consequence and I don't <i>think </i>this is supposed to be one of the worlds where su'khora are just normal, this is obviously supposed to be the morning after our <i>not </i>leaving. There's my Earth-mom, it looks like we're talking, our cat Leif wanders over and Boobsong begs to pet him apparently because she's diving off my lap and on hands and knees to say hello. He takes to her or her petting anyway and she picks him up and brings him to the table, he's completely chill about this, my youngest brother reaches out for him and she reaches across me and my dad to hand him over, then gets in my lap again and feeds me more egg. Now juice, out of my old favorite cup from when I was a kid which she must have dug out of the cupboard. I can taste it, smell the familiar way the juice and plastic smelled together, hear my breath echo in the cup, the journey is vivid though I can still feel us on the whaleship too.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Seatbelts, buckling up to go somewhere, Boobsong doing it up for me and then jumping snuggly in my lap, I'm shotgun in the Mercury minivan my parents had, we're backing out of the driveway, I look at my dad driving, twisting around to back up his face looks <i>happy</i>, back to the rainbow.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now under it is one of the seats from that minivan. Boobsong in my lap again as we drive, a glance back shows the rest of my family in the back seats including Grammie, we're driving around looking at Christmas lights! Stamford's investment bankers and trust fundies always put on good overdone shows, and we loved driving as a family to look at them. Everyone's cheerful and Grammie looks delighted, like her smile makes her look my mom's age like it irons out all her wrinkles. There's even snow this year!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Boobsong walking through the living room in Stamford with a bowl of popcorn. I'm on the end of the couch, she sits on my lap and starts feeding me, it's Christmas and the Christmas tree looms to the right. Why are its lights off? The room is dark entirely. My mom finally arrives (the rest of us are already on the couch) and I pat Boobsong off my lap and twirl in the middle of the room then squidge myself between the tree and patio door behind it and see an orange Christmas light in front of my face. I wrap my hand around it and glow every Wavelength and pour it into the bulb and through the wires until the lights are definitely <i>on, </i>then squidge out again, skip to the couch and turn to admire the tree myself--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I fight the journey, struggle to tear myself out, confused why the dreams are torturing me like this. I <i>know </i>what <i>could </i>be if my parents were magically different but they're<i>&nbsp;not</i>&nbsp;my dad might magically get over me being trans but he'll damn well never accept Boobsong no matter what I call her. She represents everything they hate and spit on! ANYWAY EITHER WE'VE FIXED IT LIKE FIFTY TIMES ALREADY OR NOT AT ALL BECAUSE THERE'S NO ALL GOOD THINGS TIMEHACK OR ANYTHING HERE, JUST THEIR MAGICALLY ACCEPTING HER LIKE IT'S NOTHING AND YOU <b>CANNOT</b>&nbsp;EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THEY'D MAKE NO ISSUE OF ME NOT GETTING SOME CLOTHES ON HER AT ANY POINT!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I can't pull away.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--now kneeling by the fireplace. A duraflame log!? We're a real wood household! I'm pulling out the tabs, opening the doors, putting it in the grate--ooh, because duraflames burn through rainbow colors. Aww, they <i>RRRGH</i> it doesn't make <i>sense </i>yes I believe my family would switch to fake logs to honor my rainbow thing if they knew about it but it doesn't mean anything because these aren't <i>them </i>this is just a fantasy because Boobsong is sitting with them on the couch without the slightest drama and unless this is just more of the world where I've been Princess Starlight the whole time in which case why show me it--how are my superpowers? I put the log in, look back at my family to make sure they're covering their eyes (I'm going to splash coherent IR everywhere doing this), hold my hands like I'm warming them instead of the other way around, there's a brilliant flash that just shows me the fireplace with perfect clarity instead of giving me a camera-flash-spot, and the ends of the log are burning. I stand, make a girly sort of down-palms gesture, close the sparks-curtain--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Back to the rainbow. One Care Bear is back: Grumpy (or whatever the crabby blue one with the raincloud was) is shaking hands with Boobsong under it now. The other Care Bears bounce back to their places and I'm looking at my pink overalls and Care Bears shirt again--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now we're back to Boobsong and me opening my room's door together with the forcefield shutting down. We turn the latch, there's that sense of reality bending as we tear the portal open and the door resists for a moment then starts coming away from the frame--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Care Bears in a meadow with blue skies, there's a cartoon rainbow, one has a balloon.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">WHAT DO YOU FUCKING WANT FROM ME, DREAMS!? WHY ARE YOU SHOWING ME ANY OF THIS!? IF <i>ALL THAT SHIT</i>&nbsp;WITH THE STRAWBERRY DYNASTY&nbsp;AND EVERYTHING HAS TO STAND&nbsp;IF I CAN'T PREEMPT ALL OF THIS BY SENDING MY PRIESTESS THE FIVE POINTED STAR AND HAVE YOU MAKE IT WORK SO BOOBSONG AND ME AND ALL OF IT STILL HAPPEN JUST WITH LESS AWFUL STUFF&nbsp;<i><b>I WANT MY FUCKING ESCAPE!</b> DON'T YOU <b>FUCKING DARE </b>SEND US BACK INTO THAT HELL! YES THOSE PICTURES ARE VERY SWEET BUT WE ALL KNOW THEY'RE NOT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF BOOBSONG AND ME GET THAT DOOR OPEN AND IT'S NOT LIMBO! <b>YOU KNOW FULL WELL THE OPTIONS ARE LEAVE BY LIMBO OR LEAVE BY GREYHOUND! TRAPPING US IN THE SAME UNIVERSE WITH THEM ISN'T GOING TO FUCKING FIX ANYTHING! </b>AT LEAST IF WE GO TO RL'YEH SADE WE'LL MEET MAMA AND EVERYTHING AND MY FAMILY CAN HAVE <b>THEIR</b>&nbsp;HAPPILY EVER AFTER WHERE I'M <b>GONE</b>!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now a Smurf with a peppermint patty on a stick like a huge lollipop marches across the scene. Papa smurf walks on next, followed by Smurfette carrying a doll, and the rest of the Smurfs follow with marching-band instruments in a long procession. The scene changes and we're watching Transformers, looking up a Devastator about to rip apart the gates to Autobot City, he looms and coldly says his only line in the movie: "PREPARE FOR TERMINATION."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It already <i>is</i>&nbsp;terminated, Dreams. This game was over the minute Boobsong manifested physically. Or implanted. Something. Now, what, you want us to go back and do our time or something? You've rebuilt the Starlight Princess so you can send her back to do battle with the world that hated everything about her? Yes I know what you showed me but it either <i>isn't real</i>&nbsp;or there's nothing to do here.&nbsp;We both know if what we've been trying to do isn't doing it already the only other way I can fix that world is measured in gigatons per second.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>AND IF YOU MAKE ME GO BACK THERE SO HELP ME THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I'LL DO. I TORE IT APART FOR A REASON. IT CAN'T BE FIXED AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT <b>SHOULDN'T BE</b>&nbsp;AND IF YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW I'M TALKING ABOUT MY FAMILY YOU AREN'T READING MY MIND AS MUCH AS I THOUGHT.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They show me a girl in a frilly pink dress and straw hat in a sunny green meadow. Black shadows cover half of her cast by the sword that's stabbing through the sky in the background.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">And? She'll be fine! She'll have a better meadow in no time!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A vision of Boobsong kneeling on my chair in Stamford reading my mom's heirloom Better Homes and Gardens cookbook looking happy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">So what, this is a test of faith? Somehow make us not go to Limbo but instead stay on Earth and see how it works out and trust that I'm not condemning both of us to a lifetime of being kicked around Earth by people who just want to see us both end up like that torn-up porn on my bed? <i>Even if</i>&nbsp;there was a good ending for that, it'd undo this whole timeloop!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Listen, this is simple:&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>They. Hate. Us.</i>&nbsp;They wanted to kill me, and her. The closest they could come was that torn up porn. They'll just do the same thing again. No version of them exists that isn't like that. These are pretty pictures but they aren't <i>real </i>unless all that stuff about redemption you lead me through is bullshit!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Q, Picard, and failure-Picard in the white void of <i>Tapestry</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Yes, pull this thread and the whole thing comes apart, you don't need to--frozen gumpdrop buttons I keep forgetting my seer, no wonder this is going wrong. Boobsong, why are the Dreams violently agreeing with me right now?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Are you fixing the pulling by staying to live with your family? Aren't we older than fifteen Princess? We had to live on Earth to come out of Limbo and maybe you forgot everything between what's happening in the journey and actually leaving to come to Rl'yeh Sade?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">If that idea was a Unicron Room I'd nuke it good but it does bring some sense to all this. Good job and from now on watch this stuff interrupt me if you see me miss something like that because it's making something go wrong with my impulse to use you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess I have one other thing what if something made your family accept me that came before you came out with me?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams will let me pull out of the visions to kiss the top of her head. Good seer, good job. You can read my mind, you know exactly when your help is useful, give it if it is.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">You're not just doing it so I think I have to be the one to say this and that's what you want but hear me out, Dreams. If this is really how it has to be, I want one thing. Let that door open on the world where that picture thing <i>did</i> happen, and let it be the very next day or that night. Don't make me and Boobsong have gone through that and them have no memory of it--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They reply with a double-image of Darth Vader and someone I seem to know is Anakin soon before he went evil, but still smiling and happy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Huh? I mean--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Anakin became Darth Vader because he had someone like you have me and he lost her, and he said you took her away now I'll wreck everything just to the world because she just died in childbirth not from anything he could take revenge on for killing her. Maybe you're doing the same thing, Princess, by saying your family wanted to destroy you and me from the porn thing?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Good seer. So what, Dreams, I just have to pretend they just tripped and fell between my mattresses and shredded everything and drew all over my picture of you while they were trying to get up again? There was malice in that, if I don't understand what or why fine but I know hate when I see it, that was the sort of thing I'd do to Eden if it was a person. You can't ask me to pretend I don't see that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">An upside-down zoetrope, animated image in the middle indefinite. That's you, seer.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">That says your brother didn't think I was anyone with feelings, that's why he could do that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Good seer. Even if I excuse that though, what about me, Dreams? I was just a picture too? Whatever it actually means I want them to deal with this if we have to and if I'm wrong and dealing with it isn't what I think fine but I stand by what I said, I know hate when I see it and that was an act of hate and either my brother is responsible or he was too young to be held respnosible and he was just expressing my parents' hate and it's their fault. This wasn't just shit happens and peope die in childbirth because life sucks sometimes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A cigarrette-chomping solider with "War is Hell" written on his helmet.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Alright even Earth figured out the Just Following Orders thing, so what the fuck? Seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess that says your brother was hurt by something else and he was acting out like that soldier guy in Forrest Gump.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me Baby Jesus as soon as she finishes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Fine. I do wish there was a way to fix things without keeping Christianity around. Apparently my brother does too. That I can believe.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">So nobody's responsible. Or they are and I've already vaporized them like six ways. Amazingly that makes a difference to me but it still doesn't suddenly make <i>any </i>sequence of <i>anything </i>able to get my family to accept Boobsong unless we go all the way to me having been Princess Starlight from the age of like four and their remembering the Strawberry Empire in which case this moment never happens and we're not doing this in the first place.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A solved Rubik's Cube.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">So...if that's the solution, what significance does this moment have at all? Why are we even here? Am I missing something, seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">That means they have a solution but it must not be you being Princess Starlight because then why are we here you said but I say the same.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">You said maybe something happened to prepare them. Did you have something in mind? Dreams?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They show me a Technic instruction book for some kind of yellow truck.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">So they gave instructions, I guess for dealing with us? Getting my parents to listen must have taken some work!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">An&nbsp;Soefta'xrn-ian&nbsp;lantern. Mama.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now they show the Enterprise-D--or a Galaxy class ship anyway. Isht Visht.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The cover of A Wrinkle in Time. Midnight hot chocolate sprinkles with too much whipped cream down my cleavage did <i>Mama and Isht Visht </i>pull a Mrs. Which<i>&nbsp;</i>on my parents!? I guess if you could manifest, Boobsong, they'd be able to do like we did at the Strawberry Castle--omigod. <i>Please</i>&nbsp;Dreams tell me they rolled up in like a Starfleet shuttle--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The front walk of the Stamford house, then a red old-timey phone: they called the house (which would have got my dad up because he'd have assumed it was the fire alarm at the church false-alarming yet again)--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Bwahahahaha!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">HAAHAHAHAHAA the look on your parents faces must have been priceless!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--so he'd be at the window to see Rarity's walker marching up the driveway.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Springy twizzlers Isht VIsht will <i>remember</i>! I bet she can show us!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now they show Big Bird and Snuffleupagus. Explaining how Lucy's imaginary friend is actually real.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Earth from orbit with the sun in the background, and a seatbelt. Telling them it's a new dawn for the whole planet, buckle up.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Boobsong's tail making a question mark. Explaining why's she all demonic, I guess?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A snare on the ground. That's what'll seduce me best (yes it will).</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A rainbow dragon in front of starscape. That'll be me being a light-being (explaining my Christmas-tree antics).</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A candle coming out of the stars lighting a candle in a wooden candlestick. They explained how a light-being got into the family.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Lens cap as from an observatory, road, twizzler, chocolate-frosted donut, Boobsong's face. Um...seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">They're projecting from far away to tell your parents you're wound up tight like a Twizzler with me and you can't be unwound.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Duh, that's from a movie projector! Good seer! And I see that whole business about WeeJee not being my friend with the donut: yes she so is my friend.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Rotating light like on a tow truck or cop car. They're here as like, emergency help.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Headset with mic. Call them if you need help (black coffee crumble bars what must teaching my dad to dreamtalk have been like?).</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A clotheshanger. No clothes on it--oh <i>no. </i>Mama what did you do thank you from the bottom of my heart fuck you so very much--wait hold up. The Contract with Satan apparently got you a license to spill if you know what I mean but not around kids, and my brothers were there at breakfast and stuff.&nbsp; How--huh?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">I could be naked if you want me and your mom says its okay for your brothers to see me and she might be a Stamford wife now but she might remember what it's like in the Strawberry Castle or maybe just have it deep in her blood just like you not to feel weird about nakedness!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She sings with mischeif saying it and I know it's because she's sure she's right and--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The girl from Peanuts who went around unstoppably calling her friend Sir, then Earth the planet, then a football, then a recorder (the instrument), then Boobsong kneeling patiently, then a green/purple/orange/blue diamond of hearts with the purple one on top and bigger.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The nudity thing also included being open about our kinks on Earth&nbsp;at least as far as her calling me stuff like Princess and her being like an instrument. This was aliens landing (touching down) to colonize the Earth. Mama explained just how much stuff our seed-ghost would be arranging for us to get away with. <i>That </i>must have been interesting--okay wait. It's one thing making porn people only have to look at if they want to, but this is saying we were like this like, in the street and around the house, where people couldn't avoid seeing it. Isn't that something different? Just Lyra's nakedness at home is already pushing it...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Constitution (the document, not the ship)? Freedom of speech, but doesn't that not--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A tomahawk--oh. <i>Oof. </i>Reservations would be created for people who couldn't deal with the new arrivals with their different culture and the superior ontological-engineering based technology they'd use to make sure the reservations happened.&nbsp;We saw how that went last time, but (Constitution) it's a free country. They can screw it up if they want to.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Picard in that episode of TNG about the Indian settlement's planet getting given to the Cardassians where he didn't want to be part of repeating that dark chapter by forcing them to leave. I mean, how is this actually not the same as that?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A rainbow strawberry pops out of the ground: the "new arrivals" aren't coloists from Away. They're people who just as much grew up there as anyone else, and were denied their proper place, and the world only has the shape it does because it was basically a nonlethal (only because its victims are unkillable) genocide and their influence on culture was entirely erased. Alright, yeah, if you have a problem with putting that right, don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out. It's not like we were going to do anything but make it really hard for some people to pretend everyone's exactly like they are.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Even so I don't know how <i>I </i>feel about it though like this is so totally sexual, you and me, it's not just nudism! The whole point is for you to be eye candy and flirt with kinky submission even you're not directly sucking my clit at the moment!<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">That's fine in the Strawberry Empire!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"ARGH! It's the times like this I really know you're a demon," I grin. "AAH! My parents had that running gag about Swedes and casual nudity, you don't suppose this gave my mom the ammo to--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Even I the Starlight Princess Miss Very Nice Boobs Says Her Cocksleeve can't finish that sentence.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"It <b>should</b> she deserves to get back what she had at least a little bit! We made her run through the timegate and now we gave back the fun part of being Strawberry Queen! I think that's justice."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I see your point but SO MANY KINDS OF ARGH!&nbsp;On the other hand, can you imagine my dad? Isht Visht had better be able to do video."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It won't even be Mama or Isht Visht or Boobsong later. My mom <i>loves</i>&nbsp;trolling him this way.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Steam came out his ears I bet and not even he knew what kind!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Nice. Dreams help diversion what happened next!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A long robe or dress, strawberry print, then a teddy bear in a pink princess dress. They explained about the Strawberry Dynasty and everything AGH NOT HELPING!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A huge square teapot with a tiny mad hatter out front sipping tea. Yes we are definitely all mad here, but...seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">The Four Dreams are square because they have four sides so that means the Four Dreams are Wonderland, and the tiny mad hatter means Rada and Isht Visht are from there.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Red dress with a black leather belt and white fur lining. It was Christmastime.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Corn on the cob. Erm, it was Thanksgiving?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Christmas decorations...oh like, right after Thanksgiving. Why the precision?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Strawberry robes again, and the curly hill from Nightmare Before Christmas.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Drippy fruit roll-ups, what happens if the Strawberry Dynasty puts on Christmas? We hadn't started decorating yet...seer what am I missing?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">If they know you're Starlight Princess Lucy the light-being they know you're a girl so maybe that changed what Christmas presents they got you and they said that to say it's in time for you to have presents that make sense now that you have me! What did you get Princess I bet it was awesome!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Oh my cherry-twist sodabottles...do you think your nectar had time to <i>educate me</i> before we came out? Can you imagine the <i>so guys I have something big to tell you</i>&nbsp;met with <i>neat so do we</i>?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A Technic differential housing. Different housing...so I <i>had</i> changed. I guess if you replace all the Limbo drama and magic lessons with just us having fun I'd get enough nectar fast. <i>That</i>&nbsp;must have been interesting. Especially since I doubt any of my old clothes would go over these curves!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Boobsong's face and a wax-sealed letter with red and green decoration. She was invited to some kind of Christmas thing? Oh! We got to do Christmas together, that was in the journey before! You must have come to pick a tree and everything AWW!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Poor Boobsong you can take my heat but how are you with cold!?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess I'm fine you heat me from inside every second by how much you need me."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"No wonder you have to be fireproof."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Her leash, looping in the air in front of me as I jumped off her back in the castle courtyard. They told our adventures in the castle--wait, that means it's Mama from the future or something!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The headlight of our tractor from Plowstar. Mama is also how that Princess on the Farm news story in the world where I was the Starlight Princess when I was four happened.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm sorry, Mama. You must be going to get so sick of rescuing me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Crumply Starfleet bedding. They explained about my being a Fairy and needing silky things and stuff.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Roll of solder. Seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">You fry easily Princess see how it's 80% lead 20% tin which has a low melting point. Princess you couldn't wear anything you had even if it had fit it would fry you! That must mean you came out with me undressed after all! I thought you must have put clothes on because your family was there but that can't be, what would you wear?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Oh sweet boobswallow pixie stix. Could Mama have at least brought me a nightie or something or can projecting not leave stuff behind? Or sheets? There's no way I'd survive my bed either!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes projecting can leave things but would Rada Princess I think she'd have fun with that. She would bring sheets I bet that's what the Starfleet bedding was that looks like the sheets sis makes."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams derail my freakout that this might actually be a point with a bottle of Zap high-grade superglue. She left me stuck naked real good.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"<i>Mama!"</i>&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Actually wait that's really clever and kind because it would give Boobsong and me the perfect excuse to just hide out in my room until stores were open and get to know each other instead of having my family process the freakout of all this by peppering us with questions. We might've had <i>days</i>&nbsp;before my parents managed to track down anything that'd both even go over my body and not give me a seizure.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"At least I hope my brothers slept through all this!"<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show...just a blank white wall, like from our house?&nbsp;Dreams, are you giving me a blank look?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A mouth and nose in a mummy-style sleeping bag pulled tight so even the sleeping person's eyes are covered--ooh, I see, that was their mental state, blank as that wall.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A silhouette of a dragonfly. I got my wings, too, that night. Is that important somehow? Like my wings rule but it doesn't seem like it'd change this story a lot?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Cherry Coke can, Poker dealer's visor. That timeloop episode of TNG, and me being bubbly-cute, but...seer?<br><br></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess it means you got the same deal as on Isht VIsht like you look just like yourself now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Good but...like I wasn't worried about that and what's it change? Advisor am I just being too picky here or is there something about that that'd be important other than having to special-order bras except I don't seem to need one?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">It means you would smell like Strawberry sugar syrup ice cream. Can you think why that would change anything?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I mean...enh--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams journey me to a meeting of the RC club my brothers and I were in for half a second. It's the Christmas party, the keilbasa and peppers and ziti in foil chafing dishes legally required to hold any such meeting in Connecticut are there, like I guess some foods might clash with my scent? Still meh?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A porpise leaping. Hur hur that's on purpose. I like Keilbasa though! That can't be it. Seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess your wings don't leave space for anything but your passage which means you need nectar to eat so you have to be able to have enough to get food so they have to make sure you can play with me otherwise you starve because you can't absorb anything. They must have explained to your mom and dad that you have to have me every few hours or you'll get dehydrated because you can't drink anything.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That...has Emotions. Uhm. Yes please have taken care of me this is so confusing--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Boobsong cooking on the stove in Stamford. Yes of course I made you be helpful and make everyone breakfast, and I'm sure you cooked with nectar for me--wait, you were feeding me fried eggs. I <i>hate</i>&nbsp;fried eggs. Hormones changing my taste?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A bottle of maple syrup, then one of those tex-mex restaurants. Seer that's for you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">I bet you would like eggs if I made them with nectar or maybe out of it! You could make me shapeshift them like my bubblegum earrings and they'd be eggs maybe somehow sweet like me but nothing weird for your family! That way everyone could get pretty and turn into themselves without me having to kiss them and stuff! Then you would eat eggs if I made them right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The instant she finishes this thought the Dreams show her face and fireplace bellows. We must have been a trip around fire! Here cocksleeve make me smores <i>muahaha</i>--OOH! I <i>have</i>&nbsp;to be fireproof too, right? If I can make smoke because I'm fusing the oxygen and nitrogen in the air into heavy elements? I get the impression that's not what this is about though.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Femme Frosty the snowman, with a very girly hat. Duh. She needs the regular playtime to survive as much as I do. If Mama didn't drill that into them Isht Visht would have. Would have anyway however much Mama did.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">An old-timey-looking globe-light on the end of a swoopy brass stem. Huh? Seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">That looks like a gas light bulb not an electric one. Gaslight came up in a book I read in the Library and it's when you tell someone something that isn't true for them like it really is true and just keep pretending they're crazy for not thinking it until either they start to or get so stressed they have a nervous breakdown. There must be something your parents gaslighted you about Rada told them to stop or she'd be mad at them but what could it be Princess I really can't think of anything!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me a blue and white awning.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"How much is that doggie in the window? Oh overpriced pussybombs she told them how much of a whore I am and probably not to be mean about it. I can't have whored on Earth, it's not safe for <i>anyone</i>, let alone a teenager!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A phone dial. I mean my voice <i>is</i> pretty great, so--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Wait, ooooooh vocation because <i>calling</i> my dad was the one who said what a good engineer I am <i>constantly</i>. I--you said that thing about me having amazing spatial reasoning but that's actually some light-being thing isn't it. Dammit Jim I'm a pornstar, not a programmer! Except not even that I'm the Starlight Princess which is more like a preistess--holy edible Sailor Moon cosplay--" (alright good we're starting to get the rust out) "--Mama's such a good manipulator can you imagine her using that to push my dad's buttons? When we get back we're making Isht Visht play us the video whether we remember all this or not."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Snarf the cat-dragon-sidekick-thing from Thundercats. Like, you're meant to be a cute sidekick but anyone would figure that out after meeting you for five seconds--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Candle in a fancy brass candlestick. It's a very magickal-with-a-k looking candle, so our whole demon/Sorceror thing, they must have explained you'd be seen serving me like a handmaiden and it's supposed to be that way and you like it and literally at least one god has died of trying to stop you. <i>That</i>&nbsp;must have been a fun conversation.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Boobsong's face and a credit card machine. <i>Mama!</i> You don't have to get into the details like that! They don't need to know she claimed--oh but they do need to know about your game--wait. You said it couldn't control me until we got here, but I remember stuff about my game being just as powerful and puppeting me and everything when I was Princess Starlight.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A bluejay, a meat grinder, Boobsong's face.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess wait it's a bird meaning you don't know I can see you. That bird's a sign of trusting your family and meat grinder is how you make me out of your fantasies all stuck together like sausage meat. They said your mom and dad and all of you can trust me because it's you making me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">My game is controlling you now that it sees you atemporally and can see that you definitely want to be played so it can go back in time to start playing you as early as it can time-travel.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A strawberry with a crown, the instant she finishes, no time to think. We already said Mama told them I'm the Strawberry Princess though?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now a soda factory? Oh, I'm the Strawberry Princess, I make fizzy fun porn with my Boobsong, but...and Mama explained that literally the entire multiverse would have their asses if they didn't rethink (or <i>think, </i>let's be honest) their attitudes about porn in such a way I can grow up to be her. Gah, getting told off by her about that is worse than anything I could come up with for that porn incident in a zillion years! Dreams can I at least <i>know</i>? Whoever's fault it is or whatever, are we unhappening that?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Lube being dispensed. That seems like a yes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">An Episcopal Church shield. Yeah that'll be a thing. The lube is something to make that teehee do down easier?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My rainbow stockings. Princess Starlight as my religious vocation I suppose, but--no, it'll be fine. The Episcopal church has been value-drifting away from orth-ortho-dox Christianity almost as fast as me. My dad has this joke about the Procession into the National Cathedral (which is Episcopal) in 2020 starting with a Bhuddist monk, followed by a preistess of Aphrodite (who I always kind of imagined naked), then a most honored channel for the ascended masters, on and on, and in the back pew one old Church Lady turns to another and says, "one more thing, and I'm leaving".</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Doc Brown--whoah. It's like that sun thing, how do I get so much out of this? She's a time traveller come from the future to avert a terrible disaster by warning those involved. Christianity's racism against su'khora is nothing but the veneer of moral rightness Eden paints on its Frankenstiening to try and make people stop heartforming and going along with that turns me into a monster who destroys the universe (twice) because of the hate it instills in me. Cue explanation of cutting me to atoms trying to find the part that's not heartforming and how none exists. I have a calling to become the Starlight Princess whose sacred work is to teach everyone to become their own Starlight Princess and if I'm allowed to run toward becoming that princess of porn as fast as I want to naturally I'll do <i>that</i>&nbsp;instead. Mama's so dramatic about me, I can imagine her telling my dad flat out that the stakes here are bigger than his career or whatever he thought his religion was and then explaining that she's not saying that to pressure him into doing anything so much as explain why my seed-ghost and game are going to be making some changes and not to make himself sad trying to fight them.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay, that'll be good. If she gets anything like she did trying to find my birth certificate my game will seem like a fuzzy little kitten after he sees Mama like that. I bet Isht Visht will even give her proper Gandalf Looming Darkness at the right points.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's just one problem: I do still think shredding Earth was the right call, both times. Maybe I was wrong about my personal exit's timing, but that's the best I can say for it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A medal with a red-and-white necklace and the medal is a shadowy silhoutte and crying eyes in the background. An award for rescuing (rescue stuff is red and white) those whose suffering (crying eyes) is shadowed (the shadowy silhouette).</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh. Um, thanks. So that's not the universe-destroying we're talking about?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The rocking chair my dad broke one of the only times in my memory he's seriously lost his temper. What, I did something worse the first time?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Earth from space, suddenly a giant every-Wavelength explosion of light I recognize from burning the bad timelines fills the picture in an instant.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Wait, why are we trying to <i>prevent</i> that? How <i>could </i>we, even if we wanted to!? Isn't that how I got this way, and didn't it free everyone else, too? "Seer, what am I missing here?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I think the Dreams say smashing what you can reach because you can't break what you're actually angry at--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"How am I&nbsp; doing that here? How is Earth anything other than the mold Eden is stamped out of? Yes it can contain good things but wasn't it specifically built to make Eden happen? It sure looks like it! Burn Earth, burn Eden, done! If this was just the <i>end </i>of us we were talking about and not winding up on that raft thinking I was nineteen, I still would think it might be the right thing to do! STAYING SCREWED EVERYTHING UP NO MATTER HOW GOOD IT WORKED OUT IN THE SHORT TERM! EVERY MOMENT EARTH EXISTS IS A MOMENT CLOSER TO THE BAD TIMELINE WITH THAT COLLEGE APARTMENT! <i>THAT'S </i>WHAT WE HAVE TO STOP AND THIS IS THE CHANCE TO DO IT SO WHY WON'T YOU LET ME DREAMS!?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The cupboard from The Indian In the Cupboard. They had a way to get Boobsong and Mama in, but not people out.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"You can give up without trying if you want Dreams but I won't--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Earth from space making a pretty crescent, then Darth Vader's lightsaber. I sigh as loud as I can.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Oh? You think there's an Earth that isn't a nightmare factory? <i>I've </i>never seen that world! How many more people have to get eaten up by it while you spend tens of thousand of years wasting time doing microsurgery on something that's not even alive in the first place?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess they're showing us. This is the Earth that's not bad like that."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I haven't seen anything that justifies sitting around waiting for Eden to reset things again and I won't believe we can't open that door on Limbo in the journey until we go there and try for real and fail. The Dreams have some kind of fucked up soft spot for Eden where Earth is concerned and I won't be part of it. Kill Earth, kill Eden. If I still get my favorite pizza shop nobody's going to even lose their favorite tree or anything. There's no <i>downside</i>, is there? Is there some kind of terrible price I don't understand? Why can't we even <i>try? </i>If it fails fine but you have to be worse than Eden to think <i>trying </i>is bad!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A blank black spot in the middle of my view with an orange spiral swooping out from it. Seer this is yours.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">It's you spewing out hate everywhere Princess I'm sorry that's what I see in it I can't help what I interpret you're making me!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Hey, pet you." I stroke her head. "Of course you can't control that, what's got into you? Good seer you read the vision. Dreams, just because I'm spewing hate <i>your </i>way because you <i>keep </i>dodging my questions doesn't mean I'm spewing it everywhere. I'm spewing it at Eden and Eden's friends <i>which you and your defense of its main base are increasingly looking like. </i>I asked questions. I'm going to keep asking them until I get answers."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Optimus Prime blasting decepticons right before he fights Megatron in the Transformers Movie. He's unstoppable, one-shots most of the Decepticon army before he even hits the ground from transforming. Seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess&nbsp;after&nbsp;that&nbsp;he&nbsp;fought Megatron&nbsp;and&nbsp;died&nbsp;from Hot Rod&nbsp;jumping&nbsp;in to save him which what you're doing with&nbsp;this.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">If I can't even ask questions, this place isn't what it seems like and we're out of here. Get ready, Acme Station, and if the next thing they say isn't an <i>answer </i>to one of the questions they keep ignoring take us out of here completely and go as far as you can without being trapped like we were on Earth and if you can just make a pocket universe or something where we can be safe until we get our heads. Got me? Hairtrigger. <i>Fast.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess I understand yes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A Patriot anti-missile missile launcher. They think, even though they're already wrong, that they can stop the next reset before it hits.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That's an answer but it's worthless, so you stay on alert until I'm satisfied, Acme Station. Answer the real question, Dreams. <i>Why won't you even try to fix this. Why is staying so Eden can torture people some more so damn important that you won't <b>try.</b></i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The score-periscope-thing of a bowling alley. Seer that's for you but if it's not an answer go first and explain after.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Because our past is there and you had fun with me and you said every Planck time and I say that too I want our fun times bowling!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I changed my mind. We have each other now. We can sacrifice a few memories to save six billion people <i>including us</i> decades of suffering. This was the last chance. I remember that much. There was no escape after the reset the Dreams let happen after this. If we don't stop it now this all may as well just be a story for all the good it does anyone."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Is that what you wanted to hear, Dreams? That I'm not so selfish I'd let the rest of Earth twist for the sake of a few of our memories? <i>Now </i>can we please fix this?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Boobsong's face, the little boat trailer from the yellow sailboat I built with my dad, and a spritzer-cookie syringe. Same rules, seer.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess you were making cookies that year and you had to step back because you were getting so mad at the stickyness making them fall apart and your dad came to find you and said hey please come back son and you were still super mad but you did anyway and he made a mistake he said afterward because you really freaked out at the table and had to step back anyway. They say to step back from asking this question and let them keep telling you the story of Rada helping your parents accept me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I give her a "good seer" pet and let the silence loom.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Give me <i>something,&nbsp;</i>then<i>. </i>I can't just forget it. I don't know what you <i>can</i> give but Christmas trees and bowling dates aren't it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">An actual Satanic pentagram, with the goat head and star upside down to be its horns, filled in with red.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I feel sick suddenly, but it's not the Dreams or anything doing it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm saying fine just get on with this but it doesn't make sense because isn't a deal with the devil more like what the Dreams are asking for where it's like get some fun times in exchange for throwing your mom under a bus not <i>stop this evil right now</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me the SDF-1 from Robotech. Alien tech the Earthling military thought it understood but which it had no idea about. Seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess that means you don't understand why they're fixing Earth this way and they can do stuff you can't know about yet.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The title screen to Super Metroid. The final boss is Motherbrain and it seems unstoppable but the metroid in a jar on the title screen gets imprinted on Samus as its mother before escaping and shows back up in the final boss room to protect its mommy by sapping a huge amount of energy from Motherbrain and giving it to Samus (which gives her a super-laser to stomp Motherbrain with) and then gets fried by Motherbrain for its trouble cocksleeve don't you dare.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Never Princess I will always keep your cocksleeve safe but I don't think they mean that. I think they mean your light-storm in the closet and stuff like that they made you super-powered to fight Eden and the alien SDF-1 is you because you're a light-being.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Road runner, Wile E Coyote ready with bib and fork and knife, Road Runner blows by too fast to see and the tops of his silverware are gone. He goes to take off his bib and Road Runner appears beside him with a giant mecha-road-runner head which meeps like Devastator saying PREPARE FOR TERMINATION and Coyote is blown sideways offscreen. The skit starts to end with the circle closing in and then Bugs Bunny walks up from offscreen outside the circle and high-fives Road Runner and leans on nothing to Hang Out.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Hehe...what? This is totally Isht Visht, but, what?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Isht Visht came up and saw perfekti ready to grab us so she chopped of their tentacles by making a forcefield and turned into a big ship of some kind and made a really loud noise that destroyed them. Wait Princess that's you in the car ride I'm sorry! You cut off that one's tentacle and definitely made a really loud noise that blew up perfekti for everyone and that was the end of Earth which is why the pupil's closing but something stopped Earth from ending Bugs Bunny who can that be? YOu and he high fived so he has to be friendly and he came from outside so he has to be outside your Earth life. Maybe he's Isht Visht or Rada? That doesn't feel right though neither of them is like him!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me the cover of a Wrinkle in Time again. They're telling the story of our Limbo escape now, but with Bugs Bunny stopping Earth ending at the last second.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now they show part from the beginning of First Contact where Picard is having either a flashback or psychic vision of being a drone on a Borg cube in the middle of the huge torus thing, then the swamp guys from the GI Joe movie, referencing the best line in it, as the hispanic Joe whose name I can't remember ambushes the swamp guy Cobra (who is inexplicably British) and punches him out before he can do anything: "'ello 'ello 'ello--" "Adios adios adios!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Seer?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Okay Bugs just means code bugs! He's a bug in the system that keeps it from ending like it's supposed to and you make friends with it. Then Picard has this vision of being still Borg even though he's safe now and it helps him destroy that cube in the Battle of Sector 001 just like you with conflation-jumps to get into the places where if we shot at them it would destroy the whole thing and then the swamp guys are you saying adios which means it's time to let go of this because it's already done and if you try to keep going it stops Earth from ending because of those program bugs."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That same sickness from the Satanic thing wells up again and I sob with how I want to go back to hearing stories about Mama with my parents and fun times with Boobsong. Eden is evil because it's the fight that never ends. That's why it couldn't stop fighting the seed-ghosts that handed me Disney among other things. That's the bug in the system. Fighting when it doesn't make sense anymore is what it was <i>made of</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Party balloons. Yay you get it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Blue and white gummi shark. Sharks have to keep swimming to survive. Let's keep moving.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Portrait of Boobsong. She must have talked about what you're like, pussypet, to prepare them. Even more? Or did she show a picture?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Isht Visht in airship mode SWIRLY PINSTRIPE CINNAMON BUTTPLUGS NO SHE SHOWED THEM THE COURTYARD THING!? I mean your dragon form rules but AAH!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A scroll. She showed them my Strawberry Dynasty birth certificate wrinkly bubblegum comics this totally a parent gushing about there kid except to my parents who would just eat it up because it's me oh <i>no </i>they would <i>encourage her&nbsp;</i>what next dreams if I could get my hands off Boobsong I'd be peeking through my fingers now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That Hubble picture, Pillars of Creation. My origins as a light-being? Do we even know anything about that? I guess I thought my kind aren't so familial.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Winch overlaid with Boobsong's face. Pulling Boobsong--oh! How I implanted <i>you!?</i>&nbsp;Sweet gummi cocksleeve we don't know that do we! It's not my birth certificate, it's your dreamskin!<i>&nbsp;Oh my god Mama.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Wait.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Boobsong you're hentai <i>now </i>because we went to Earth and hentai's part of my culture, but...that handmaiden disguise power...in the Strawberry Empire were you a <i>romance novel?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes that feels right for me I'm a book I have pages they have sexy things and you turn to the part you want to read of me yes Princess I'm your manga now but I was your romance novel then. Princess there was a book that's my dreamskin and Rada brought you Iit 'm sure that's what this is saying!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Squeeze you tight little H-manga. We must have it at the camp or Heart Home mustn't we? I want to read it with you!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Also Dammit Mama I don't know how have you care this much.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The cover of A Wrinkle in Time again. Um...it had that like pegasus--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Security camera. Pulling a Mrs. Which again, they'll be watching. Be nice, Mama--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Egyptian stuff, Pharoahs and stuff--wamp wamp. Mummy. She told them she's my Mama&nbsp;as justification for watching&nbsp;(oh <i>dear</i>&nbsp;how much ageplay did she explain).</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A round-edged drawer in like a kind of dungeony wall with an HR Giger vibe, cartoonish skeleton. Home in Rl'yeh Sade, the Bones, probably either reading the Five Pointed Star or a quick version of it, but I don't get the drawer? Seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess it sounds like something else like your brother Gregor's name listen a round edged drawer around Gregor what's that mean though around Gregor HR Giger Bones? Rl'yeh Sade Bones yes I see that because Monster's home but what does that mean Princess? I'm just a dumb cocksleeve I can't get this one!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This has to be something with the fact that he'd do that porn thing if somebody doesn't do something, though he'll have a hard time pulling it off now. Mama must know about it though, so like, she's watching us around him? That leaves out the Rl'yeh Sade Bones thing. It's not a complete sentence. Around Gregor Rl'yeh Sade (the Bones)...what? Dreams? Around Gregor you what?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">R2D2? Around Gregor they carry the Death Star plans? Seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess I can't see this one I'm sorry!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Bones have a princess saying help me Obiwan you're my only hope? Is he in some kind of trouble? Who would Obiwan be? ARGH GOOEY CUMDROP GUSHERS TOO COMPLICATED AGAIN. Around Gregor they have a message. Alright what is it if it's important for us to hear now Dreams?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">R2D2 greyed out, holographic Leia in color. The message is Princess Leia? Oh, he's asking for help I think. Like people always say stuff like that thing with my porn is a cry for help.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now the Dreams show me a Thumbs Up. Yay I figured it out my brother is in trouble--but if Mama's telling my parents he'll be okay. It's probably something their worldview kept them from seeing like me being trans they'll about-face so hard on once they see it he won't know which end of the lollypop is candy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Starscape with a door in it. I want this to be changing the subject but I know it's not. He needs what I teach or will teach or whatever--that's so many kinds of impossible, though! My relationship with him was terrible <i>before</i>&nbsp;that whole thing, my being a girl isn't going to improve it, and if the cry for help tells what the help needs to be <i>with</i>--I'm just going to have to teach my parents or something. Or had to. It's hard to remember all of this is already in the past. I should chill. Let the grownups have sorted it out.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">White birthday cake with a candle on it but the candle is covered by a censor bar. I think--Dreams is it really important for us to have the details on this now? Isn't it already in my past anyway, like, it is what it is and this is a matter of unsealing what's hidden not doing it now? If so let's move on I'm sure you and Mama and my Earth parents and game and seed-ghost have got this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Me in my Starlight Princess outfit, "wand" in hand. I'm not saying I don't want to help or this isn't what I do just, like, I mean aren't I about to remember anyway?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Tall rollerskate boots. Roller derby (isn't that a lesbian thing or something? <i>It will be when Boobsong and I get there muahah!)</i>&nbsp;um oh circular track the timeloop. I need to know now because timeloop something okay that doesn't <i>not </i>make sense which is about as far as I ever get with this time stuff but Dreams all of this is so <i>messed up </i>this should be his parents doing this!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Distant but clear I can hear the apocalypse trumpet blowing from the shore of Limbo suddenly. It makes a weird sensation like slipping tiny clutches everywhere come over me where the hair on my neck would stand up, except I don't have any hair or the muscles that would move it, so my body just feels glassy smooth nothingness where it tries to make them. It's a weird, sexy feeling and I want more of it, but the reason is weirding me. Why here, why now?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A white fluffy cat, a bowtie sitting there, untied. Because I'm deciding if I'm the Bond villain or 007 himself.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Fuck that, <i>Mama</i> is Link James Link, <i>I'm</i> the sexy overlord and I've already got myself a white pussy thanks Dreams. Like I know that's the "wrong" choice here but if the Dreams were moralizing they would have gone back to Darth Vader and Anakin or something.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">What's that mean here?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It means I'm holding the Earth hostage. That's what Bond villains do, right? Except my ransom is heartforming, not money. Let people heartform, especially teenagers like I'm about to become when that door opens, or that apocalypse I arranged in the Exploding Room kicks in. If even <i>one kid</i>&nbsp;in your timeline gets to where I can hear them while I'm stabbing Earth to pieces, <i>blam</i>. Game over. Enjoy Limbo just imagine you're on the Haunted House at Disneyworld you'll be okay in a couple of centuries except you won't experience them.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">What's this mean for my brother, though? I guess it'd be pretty bad not to help him if I believe in this so much, but is he even remotely the kind to heartform? It doesn't matter, is the answer. I targeted the sound my heart made when Boobsong seemed not just ripped away from me but theoretically impossible, but surely other things can cause that kind of suffering. Maybe my ransom is all of that stuff, then. Take one child's dreams away that totally, and the world will end.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Maybe less totally than that. It's worth being careful. I'm still not sure <i>exactly </i>what I did with that targeting. I was really upset.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now I see me holding the cat, a book, and putting white gloves wedding gloves on. Gearing up, decision made, I'm the sexy overlord. And I guess I have a book I'm sharing?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh holy fizzfrozen strawberry toner particles. Yes I have a book I'm sharing. What is my life <i>about?</i>&nbsp;Mama's explaining my heartforming evangelism thing like from the rainbow temple and E3 and saying Gregor can use my help and a seedling could give him the help he was calling for that day with the porn thing, and saying his sister (now) can help him out with that if they arrange for it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Mon-starr's bat-creature using it's fangs-grappling-hook to pull up a lego set that I <i>think </i>is a castle, Batman. Gregor's Monster (he has the toy) pulling up his medieval side to play with is part of the plan (Batman always has a plan).</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">...and she's telling them they have no choice because it's part of some cosmic plan.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They show me a ground-level view of me descending from the sky in the Strawberry Courtyard to walk among my subjects gah I really just called them subjects.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">But I get the idea. Be a big sister.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Is that it then? Are we going now?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">An RC joystick. I'll be controlling the journey when we get back there--</p>
