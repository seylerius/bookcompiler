    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">88 - Write Protected</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"YES. Game you have it, right? Just like my outfits?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: the game has clothing taken from Earth and it can get things out as Earth is dying by time-travelling to get them for me, but it can't take things I've been using on Boobsong off her and my collar was around her neck at the moment the reset after this deleted it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Bitter fury wells up, because that wasn't the only thing it deleted.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">WHAT!? I can make a new body again but that was very important! We made that collar together!!!! Princess that's horrible! Let's take it just at the last moment!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">As soon as she's done the Dreams show me...my lost collar huge around a monolith. I can't see if there's text but it's definitely a game-monolith with the sloping sides and vine and strawberries.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I can see lots it <i>could </i>mean, but not what it <i>does </i>mean. Seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Look at how small that monolith is. It's the one from your happy meal, Princess!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The dreams show me a head in profile, hair in pigtails. Seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess it's pony-tails it's pony-time! That means Rarity made this! Why's that matter maybe she helps somehow--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It already did! Rarity is--hehe is my grandma, of course she'd know about the resets and stuff--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A radar screen? Along with the shapeshifting it'd obviously need to be right for pony and dragon and cocksleeve she must have made it able to detect a reset coming--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The disk and streamers of a supermassive black hole?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">That's the way it works then! It falls into the disk then shoots out on the streamer! There must be somewhere sideways to the real world it gets shot out to and we can go just take it! Why's it work that way why not just take it back to Heart Home?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I bet because this way it's around your neck until it disappears, and then the collar goes sideways, so that when Eden--when Eden erases our life it's still on you. So let's go get it! How do we get there, Dreams? Game, why didn't you just bring it from there?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: the game can't get it, because the journey into our past isn't complete yet. I need to have everything to know how to get there.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Then let's get moving! What's the next piece, Dreams!?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Hands grinding a pepper grinder over salad? Oooh, more dates! Awesome? Hehe did I really take you to the Olive Garden, cocksleeve? That's so silly!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A purple plastic comb with some kind of cartoon character for the handle. Oh, yes of course, when we were like fourteen. That's totally a fourteen year olds trying to be fancy date, hehe!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh. We're missing like our whole teenage love life. Our whole <i>private </i>life really. It's all been celebrity and Starlight Princess stuff.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me a reel of ribbon, then a spaceship, then overfizzing strawberry soda with two straws in it and I shake with sobs and hug Boobsong close because I can feel the hole where it should be: our <i>real</i> relation<i>ship</i> is the silly fun times and companionship and talking we shared on stupid adolescent dates like this. I think...it never had anything to do with our age. We're just <i>like that.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A pen on a reciept on the little reciept-tray of a restaurant. Yes of course let's not forget all the making out in the everywhere and sex and kinky fun after dinner! You don't have to remind me though, Dreams, so, seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess that's the tip you're leaving. That's just the tip there's so much else!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Look at me now, demonpet. Is this what it feels like to be a dragon?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Looking...</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes you say that's mine I want all of it I'm taking and keeping it eternally and I won't let go ever RRRAAAAGGH. RRRR I feel the same way Princess let's take our memories back!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">&nbsp;Let's just go super angry want you back!!!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Hey Dreams, Geron--Geron-ron-roni--" <i>pluck</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">RRAAAH SAY IT WITH YOU "--MOOOOOOOOO!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A fried egg, an upside-down grocery cart wheel, the door of my room in Stamford opening, Legos stacked up, multicolored, computer keyboard.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">...start from that moment coming out of my room in Stamford after Mama spent the night getting my family ready for the new world and go piece by piece building on it like with Legos by writing our memoirs together, but the colorful chaos of the Legos means there might be surprising jumps around in time--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">HUGE Green Checkmark, and then a huge black mirror extends from the ceiling and I swivel the chair to face it--heh, this makes us look backwards, like at the past.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">And then journey takes us and I'm half-asleep in my bed in Stamford and Boobsong is saying:</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Hey, Lucy, wake up Princess!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The experience is WEIRD, and <i>awesome. </i>It's journey like the other ones, but instead of being a recording, somehow even though I'm aware of being in the Whaleship in our seat with Boobsong snuggling me I also have gone into this past with her. I'm the person who remembers this, but while we're journeying here I'm living it new with all the free will and inexperience of who I am in this memory. I can only act like she would (<i>he</i>, augh, I'm femme still on the whaleship here but in this journey I'm horribly nectar-shy) or it feels like the journey will either jam like stuck gears or fracture off into fantasy that won't feel real like this. Boobsong's voice appears in the black mirror, I hear it as words in the journey, and in my lap she's in a trance--when I look in her head, I see:</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">[ Vision: huge olive ]</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Hehe the Olive Garden! It means she's just <i>in </i>the memory, lucky thing. Well what happened next!? I don't want to remember being a boy but I know we fixed that before we came out of the room.</p>
<p data-voice-id="wLf8QRk58">Sleep fills my eyes as I wake up. Soft pillows cradle me and the blankets are warm but I'm on my back somehow, counter to my obligatory sleeping habits, and a weight--there's someone in my bed with me!? It's a girl, that's impossible, unless Dreamless came true somehow, but the high breathy sweet voice is <i>not </i>Gregor or Morton or even my mom gently waking me. I fight with my sleepy eyes to open them--holy shit it's a succubus!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm somehow able to journey and work the black mirror at the same time, easily. I can see what's happening, experience it, write stuff down in the black mirror, go back and re-experience earlier bits of what's happening just by reading back to myself that part of what I wrote and rewrite things to be more accurate to my memories. When I start to peel away from the memories, the Dreams tug at me like tapping or pulling at my body in the seat on the Whaleship to warn me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Wake up, Lucy, come on, it's your seedling here! Don't you want to find out what's happening? Don't you want me to sssslowly slide these covers down and put your cock inside myself and ride until you cum in me? You'll really really like it! This won't be scary bad stuff. I'm really just your sexy friend from Dreamless and your fantasies."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">I speak very sexily. Please Princess please come back to me!</p>
<p data-voice-id="wLf8QRk58">She's <i>gorgeous</i>&nbsp;with thick full lips and soft face and body soft to match them, huge breasts heavy right on top of me with her nipples barely peeking out--she's naked of course--and her voice is making me feel like I'll explode if I don't take her by the hips and put myself inside her like she's suggesting immediately--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I try to see what happens next, and instead the Dreams show me Boobsong wielding a SPNKR missile launcher from Marathon, a picture that has <i>layers </i>I think Bungie would be proud of, but it lines me up on the next part of the journey: she's just done a conflation jump because after you play Marathon Infinity to the end it's time for multiplayer and I can remember being a multiplayer <i>terror </i>with the rocket launcher and Marathon Infinity had those dream levels that are like conflation jumps and this is now the afterglow--here's one of those timejumps, then! We're going to write down every last&nbsp;<i>bit&nbsp;</i>of our relationship to the tiniest moment of flirty schmoopy-eyes but right now I want my fizzfreezing collar back around my cocksleeve's neck and there's no way the Dreams haven't noticed that so whatever crazy path through these memories takes us there Dreams let's&nbsp;<i>go</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">...aaand <b>that's</b> just like our honeymoon, now just look at me, keep looking carefully, that's it...</p>
<p data-voice-id="wLf8QRk58">Pleasure just from holding her against me feels like it'll burn my brain out. The <i>afterglow </i>with her is better than sex. How could I have possibly resisted this? Why would I have <i>wanted </i>to? I pet her soft, silky face where she lies on the pillow facing me, and she turns to nuzzle my hand, looking rapturous like I'm grabbing her pussy, except I've seen her face for <i>that </i>now and seeing it again really might just burn my head out.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Very soft silently conflation jump prah.</p>
<p data-voice-id="wLf8QRk58">Light fills the room--wait, what is this, where are we now!? Somehow, we're in my bed and someplace else at once, a hotel bed--<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Now just keep holding me...here we go it's happening!</p>
<p data-voice-id="wLf8QRk58">No, it's--I'm having a vision! My physical eyes still see the beautiful creature in front of me, but, this is like memories but how can it be--</p>
<p data-voice-id="wLf8QRk58">--a beautiful silver-and-diamond choker, no, the heavy metal fittings and thick cross section aren't something from a jewelry store, that's a <i>slave collar</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>wow </i>that's lots of diamonds. It's sitting on a pillow made of satin rainbow stripes, on what my mind thinks is the dresser in my room in the sense of being sure it's where my clothes are and boringly familiar, but it looks totally different than the one in my room right now--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Giggling at the silly recursivesness of this, I let the memory-memories come to me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="wLf8QRk58">--a giant cube of something clear like glass in front of me. The collar hangs inside of it right near the top, and there's a shape cut out of the inside of the block, the shape of her body like she was wearing the collar and kneeling with her hands on her thighs and butt on her feet and legs apart. She's over my shoulder like a giant pastry bag, I stand her on the cube in a wide dish cut out of the top of it and make a gesture and she slowly starts to <i>melt </i>from her feet up so she's pouring through the collar into the mold, sinking slowly down unstoppably--</p>
<p data-voice-id="wLf8QRk58">--now she's <i>in there</i>, herself again but sexier, her neck poured through the collar because it has no way of opening. The mold holds her completely motionless but I can see the life in her eyes. I step down a couple of steps, see hundreds of people in like pews in a huge curving rainbow-shiny cathedral watching us for a moment and then I've turned to face the mold and hold out my hands (which squishes out my breasts a bunch wait my <b><u><i>WHAT!?</i></u>&nbsp;</b>holy fuck I'm <i>naked, </i>too) in front of me and something feels warm and ringing at my palms like I'm singing there and the cube starts to glow, orange and white and melting down away from her but she's <i>fine</i> except for a determined happy smile as the molten glass reveals her head and breasts--</p>
<p data-voice-id="wLf8QRk58">--the fancy flying-angel hood ornament of our vintage-limo&nbsp;<i>wedding getaway car</i>, red carpet, what the hell <i>is </i>this the world glitters with camera flashes all around us like we're some kind of celebrities but all that feels far away because my eyes are glued to her as she crawls beside me on a leash attached to the collar, climbs into the back seat in front of me--</p>
<p data-voice-id="wLf8QRk58">--a flash of turbofan blades gets me to see that we're on and airplane but this is the cabin of a private jet of some kind and she's straddling me so we can join the Mile High Club--</p>
<p data-voice-id="wLf8QRk58">--now the collar on its cushion on my [? translation error: <i>other</i>] dresser again, just sitting there, this is different, it's like I'm <i>here </i>and not remembering--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"That journey's really there for you, don't you want to take it back and collar me?"<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Sobbing the happy soft longing of a good memory, I break out of the journey, hehe <i>journies</i>&nbsp;and nudge Boobsong awake.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"We have to conflation-jump our <i>honeymoon</i>."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Let's do it then come on Princess I'm ready to be collared now let's hurry go and do it!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Lash my tail excitedly, wings all up with horniness!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"There's a bed right back there, and--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">And my heart is jammed trying to imagine feeling what I felt in this memory. We don't need anything but each other to have the most beautiful kinky sex that's ever been had in the whole history of horniness new every time and then cry tears of joy for the afterglow, but this wasn't just that. Fucking her in my childhood bedroom and then afterglowing knowing instead of Limbo and then lostness in a strange new world (even if it <i>is </i>literally heaven) we were going to walk out and introduce her to my family and the comfort of home and <i>go hang Christmas lights</i>&nbsp;was an overwhelming sugar-rush like grape and strawberry bubblegum at once--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--journey takes us, writing into the black mirror where are we <i>oh</i>--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The door swings open on the darkness of the hallway, and light pours out.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">From <i>me. </i>Rainbows cover the doors to Morton's room (closed, what a relief) and the linen closet and pour down the stairs from my <i>wings</i>&nbsp;that I'm already instinctively folding back without even thinking about it to get through the door and when I look down I see the satin-covered curve of my <i>breasts </i>and floofy starscape of my <i>dress </i>shining because I can <i>glow</i>--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I blink out of journey for a moment. I had my Starlight Princess outfit? Not that I mind, but Dreams why say that thing Mama leaving me stuck naked if this happened?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A french horn.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">What's this have to do with the apocalypse?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The girl in cryosleep from Crystalis. To wake me up--wait a minute--back into journey--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--and also this dress and these shoes and rainbow stockings and hair bow carefully tied by my <i>demonic handmaiden</i> are the first clothes I've been able to wear since the start of this a day and a half ago and they only came to me half an hour earlier in a box left in an alternate version of this world by my fairy's godmother who is a sentient telekinetic <i>pony </i>and we just picked it up out of the alternate universe and brought it here like you do that every Monday reached in and pulled and there it was in my hands filled with all sorts of things that bring back memories I still haven't processed except I know unshakably from the very bottom of my heart that my name is Princess Lucy Starlight-Hardred and I'm a <i>girl </i>who came from another world but grew up in Stamford and Maine and has always at least since I was too small to remember <i>not </i>having her been with the companion whose hand is on this doorknob with me and who needs her like air and am leaving this house never to come back again if my family can't accept her. The rest we can negotiate <i>maybe </i>but not Lyra Boobsong Starlight-Hardred my <i>wife </i>who I <i>married </i>when we were <i>fourteen</i>&nbsp;because she's <i>destiny </i>and not just a girlfriend and I mean that literally because one of my names for her is <i>Acme Station </i>after the powers she has but that's not what makes her destiny for me that's called a seed-ghost and it makes everything work out right for us--I can remember <i>losing </i>a court case with Disney and then having it and the game she made for me turn it around <i>after the judge pronounced a verdict</i>&nbsp;and that's just a small example of the power they weild and I do hope we're good guys because the world's going to change one way or another with them and people like <i>Boobsong </i>in it and <i>I'm</i> the help understanding what the hell is happening our world gets which is more fun than it sounds like that speech with president was really quite scary especially with the projecting my mind to give it in Washington while I sat in my bed and held Boobsong's hands but I felt so <i>alive </i>afterward and I feel that way now a bit as I take this first step across the threshold <i>heh</i>&nbsp;there's no <i>man</i> involved in this or I'd make a moon landing reference it sure feels like a giant leap okay here we go cocksleeve on three! <i>One</i>, look at her so sweet and arched ready to proudly walk out of here naked because that's okay apparently being as I already got her on national TV that way in the first five hours of this <i>two </i>ihow my dad's going to deal with his <i>lesbian daughter</i> having a wife who's a succubus is hard to imagine but they meaning <i>Sharon </i>can't say <i>Charon </i>when she's a girl can we except her real name is Rauda like <i>Rauros</i>&nbsp;who is the apocalypse rider of Death on the pale horse in Revelation is <i>downstairs </i>with my parents waiting for me and reassured me already it's going to be okay because she explained everything, including how I'm the rider of <i>Conquest </i>and <i>Easter Bunny </i>(I'd think I was crazy but crazy me would be more serious!) and bring people heartforming because it's part of a plan to bring Earth to paradise <i>three</i>&nbsp;here we go cocksleeve!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Ulp take the step...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Nothing explodes and the world doesn't come to an end <i>wHiCH I gUEsS iS a wOrRY wItH mE. </i>My light makes it look like I'm carrying a bunch of Christmas lights on the door in front of us.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I look at beautiful inhuman Boobsong and turn for the stairway. We're alone in the upstairs hallway, but I can hear talking downstairs--that's Gregor's voice, well I guess we're meeting the whole family then. I've talked to all of them through the door and forcefield on it, they heard me scream as I changed into a girl again (the forcefield was usually soundproof, but could not be) so they would know it's still <i>me </i>behind these rainbow eyes (<i>that </i>is the <i>coolest</i>, I never thought I would like <i>this </i>as a style but it's <i>perfect</i>).</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The game that's keeping me from being happy and blinding everyone with billion-watt lasers also made sure we stayed this long to be sure I'd be ready to present myself as my true persona and not the fake one I've been wearing because I thought I male. Princess Lucy Starlight, here she comes with her Heartsong Lyra on her arm shining like <i>Heartwarming </i>which is what the holiday coming is called and Santa get this is real you can bank on that the <i>Sugarfeast Fairy </i>told you and sHe woULd kNoW wOuLDn'T shE?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">All of this is crazy it must be except I'm pretty sure fairy wings that are imaginary don't make you grit your teeth when you brush them accidentally on the stairway because you're distracted taking that first step with your eravahk that looks like a fairy magic wand in one hand and your succubus bride in the other and the leash connecting them brushing where your cleavage would be if your dress had a boob window which it disappointingly doesn't have because apparently you're a huge exhibitionist whose usual outfit is rainbow stockings and a bright shiny (literally) smile and this is just what you wear for kid stuff and family and that's not even the crazy part because let's talk about the Rainbow Cathedral and the things that happened <i>there</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My wing-light shines on the wall of the landing ahead, moving like we're carrying a Christmas tree down the stairs. I keep my eyes on it so I won't freak out any more than I already am, except for glancing at at at <i>Boobsong </i>to see she's still as real as she was a minute ago--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There are gasps from the front hall to our left when we get to the landing <i>argh </i>they're all waiting in the hall for us aren't they eyes ahead just keep walking wall in front of us okay ready remember you're showing submission and loyalty Boobsong here we <i>go--</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Grab your hand super tightly Princess your handmaiden will be cute for them yes and she says you look beautiful you can do this!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I go to turn and can't because my wings hit the wall and there they all are the only thing I can do is come down off the landing into the middle of them tugging Boobsong with me to get enough space to turn wait what there's my dad hugging me heh it's even a man-hug with back-pat, I hug back, I guess he recognizes me and isn't too scared of Boobsong now he's handing me to my mom is she crying I reach for her and she hugs me with one of her gentle hugs and then pulls back from me and says:</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Let's look at you..."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Eep now it's Princess' cocksleeve's turn! Hi Princess' Mom see her handmaiden is nice!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Mom looks shocked I should have tried to conjure Boobsong some clothes--wait why is mom smiling now--I look at Boobsong, but she's just <i>ooh </i>she's snuggled against me looking vulnerable and shy yes that will get my mom.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Snuggly small cocksleeve is harmless see?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"This is my seedling Lyra. Say hi, you." I smile the last part down at Boobsong where she's shy-ing beside me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Look up and be super sweet "Hi everyone!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Hello!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My mom thinks she's the cutest thing <i>ever</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"You aren't too cold, are you? We can turn the heat up."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">And just like that we're back to Standard Mom Operations. Isn't anyone going to freak out? Pluck.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I'm just like Princess, always never cold. It's very sweet you asked me though!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Holy fuck, Mom really is the Queen. Was or something. Anyway the whole family is standing around quietly waiting to see what she'll do like it's all up to her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Before she can do anything, though, Morton gasps.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Look outside, family!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My Mom who's still holding onto my shoulder turns, but of course Gregor's the first to get to the narrow window beside the front door:</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Wwhhat? How'd they get here!?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My mom lets go and turns around to look out over Morton's head and also gasps, and my dad shares with Morton, so I lead Boobsong into the living room to look out of the big window there. The lights are off but my glow still reflects so I have to get right up to the window to see out into the night--<i>oops</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Ruh-roh,"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">comes my dad's voice from the other room, in his best Scooby impression.</p>
