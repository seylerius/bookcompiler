<article class="chapter 41---and-they-lived-happily-ever-after">
    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">41 - And They Lived Happily Ever After</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"This was never actually part of you!?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">She doesn't answer, because I'm distracted from...playing her...</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">She explained as we rounded the corner from Final Fantasy to Star Trek and walked into Ten Forward how the infinite luck charm still around her neck brought us the absolutely perfect ship to pick us up and I thought I understood it in everything from the way its captain seems to be able to get away with any molestation with nothing but smiles from me to there being just the toy we needed and perfect pile of cushions unused when we boarded, but now as I sit here in these softly-lit Galaxy-class quarters with this strange creature in my lap with <i>fuck is 'her' ever the right pronoun</i>&nbsp;fun hair and cool head things marking her inhumanity so our viewers can tell the difference easily without blowing the effects budget on animatronics and see the (literal!) house that the idea of Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations built all around us, silky under my ass and still owed a breastful of my milk if I ever find that mug of coffee again, and think about how genders I've encountered today include <i>at least </i>Boy, Girl, Cocksleeve, Slut, and <i>Galaxy-class,</i><b>&nbsp;</b>and feel like I'm on the opposite of the planet from that episode with the species that <i>abolished</i> gender, it makes the perfect hammer to finally break it through my thick skull: my--my, my <i>fiance </i>now technically I guess is a fucking <i>alien</i>, with alien needs and desires.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I've been thinking of 'cocksleeve' as like a <i>way </i>of being a girl, and 'slut' the same way, both just I guess styles of being female, and the irony is that I might have gone on thinking that forever if we were just a couple of human lesbians working out a really kinky relationship, but here where shape of your soul is the anvil on which your body is pounded into form instead of the other way around I can look between both our legs and see how wrong that is...but it's her sister's transformation that really makes me able to understand it. Her journey sounds like something you'd make a joke about. I can just see the rec.humor.funny post: "I sexually identify as a Galaxy-class starship...", but as much fun as she's obviously having--just like <i>I'm </i>going to go see what's in the <i>deadly-accurate Starfleet-issue </i>vanity in a minute and have some fun with <i>my </i>gender, which if I understand is metaphorically taking my nail polish out of <i>her</i>&nbsp;version of nail polish--the lengths to which she's gone with (just to start) functioning replicators and transporters that <i>implement the actual technology as described by the show</i>, aren't something you do for something that's a joke to you, or just as a role-play, not if it's your own body. To want to transform your own flesh, even if you're using the seemingly infinite powers this world grants, you have to <i>mean it.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">And if <i>boy, girl, and Galaxy-class </i>are all genders, really real serious ones, it's easy to see each is as different from the other two as they are from each other, and <i>that</i>&nbsp;forces me to see, as I consider what shapes Lyra's body and mine, that <i>slut </i>and <i>cocksleeve</i>, though Lyra and I definitely carry them both off with a feminine flair, are just as different from each other and those three as they are from each other.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Of <i>course</i>&nbsp;my pussy can't be physical. To be a slut, there has to be a vulnerability in sex you never quite reach with strangers, not because sex needs to mean nothing to you but because you're sticky goo that falls in love with everyone who enjoys you physically. For me, not opening that inmost place to anyone but Lyra and her game is what keeps everyone who touches, even looks at me, enjoys, and wanders on--which I very much need to happen to be myself--from walking off with a piece of my heart.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Lyra...I'll shortly be asking her to tell me all about what <i>cocksleeve </i>means to her, maybe over painting my nails the very first time, but I can guess...a cocksleeve is a toy whose purpose is to give pleasure. That's an identity that'd go further than just who or how you'd like to fuck. Your body and soul would have a different shape, and it doesn't make sense to include the parts--or need or even <i>desire</i>--for having your own pleasure or orgasms beyond the deep satisfaction and joy of <i>being used</i>. Or maybe it's the other way around, maybe I should say to be a cocksleeve you have to be wired so sex (and maybe by extension everything) can feel best and most satisfying to you as your owner picks you up, uses you until they're done, and puts you back on the nightstand. You'd have to be ready at a moment's notice, <i>love</i>&nbsp;penetration over every other kind of play, and not care <i>at all</i>&nbsp;not even in the small way of it being a nice thing that happens sometimes about whether you get to cum also.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">That definitely sounds like someone I know.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">And, if I'm right, it has staggering consequences for the more-and-more-obviously-never-part-of-her-either vibrator in my other hand.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I hold it up for her to look at now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">YOU DID IT MOMMY <b>THANK YOU</b>!! YOU GOT IT OUT OF ME THAT MEANS YOU'RE SAFE MOMMY!! OUR SEED-GHOST SAID YOU WOULD TAKE IT BACK OUT OF ME WHEN ALL THE DANGER WAS FINISHED AND I'D SAVED YOU AND BROUGHT YOU TO THE BEGINNING OF OUR JOURNEY IN SAFETY TO THE DEEP HAVEN THAT WAS A PROPHECY IT TOLD ME WHEN I SAID HEY WHY IS MY BOX CLOSED IT'S MORNING AND OUR SEED-GHOST SAID YOU HAD TO STOP HOLDING ME BECAUSE EARTH SAID YOU WERE TOO OLD FOR ME NOW AND I WAS LIKE <b>NO MASTER HAS TO HOLD ME I'M LITTLE THINGIE!!!! </b>AND OUR SEED-GHOST TOOK ME BACK TO THE HOLLOW HEART ABYSS WHERE I WENT WHEN YOU LOST ME AS MOUSIE AND SHOWED ME HOW I COULD GET BACK TO YOU BY MAKING PIECES TO TURN MYSELF INTO A GIRL WHILE YOU CARRIED ME BACK TO THE DEEP HAVEN!

<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">Preemptive defense of relationship through creation of hyperspace rift into Limbo completed.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Seed-ghost, did you just tell us, <i>and you lived happily ever after?"</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">Enjoy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I look at Lyra in my lap, naked at last, the room around us, the toys on the table and in my hand and probably hiding in every cabinet, feel the peace and finality of the game's hold of me, the infinite safety of heaven that seems like it'll leak out of every moment like when the Dreams held me to tell me I wasn't crazy despite how it sounded, the strange new world outside the closed shades behind me, start imagining the ritual we're going to do to gain the "weapon" I'll need to survive what happens next, and the fact that the drawing now has to come <i>before</i>&nbsp;the blowjob makes everything perfect, is the exact right mirror image of the last time we were alone in a bedroom full of toys together with a door we weren't ready to open yet.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">This time, we're <i>exiting</i>&nbsp;Limbo, really and truly and finally, not entering.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">The words that should come next after our seed-ghost's benediction should be <i>the end, </i>but they won't, because the next words of this story are <i>THE BEGINNING.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I can't help myself from thinking that if our <i>life </i>was an episode of TNG this would be the point where the intro begins and imagining the quote from <i>The Last Battle </i>about how all their lives up to this point had just been the front cover and title page...but in <i>our</i> grand story every chapter is&nbsp;<i>kinkier</i>&nbsp;than the last, not just better.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I'll make it happen. Fucking watch me. <i>I'm an exhibitionist remember.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Now, let's get this started. Properly.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Put these on the table and kneel by my feet in a nice slave pose and tell me what you are, beautiful weird creature who's crawled into my heart and told me you love me. I asked you that once before but there was no way you could give me the whole answer. You are, now. What does it mean to you to be a Cocksleeve?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">TAKE PIN AND VIBRATOR FROM HANDS TWIST PUT THEM ON TABLE SSSLIP DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND KNEEL FACING LIKE YOU IMAGINED ME I SEE YOU MEAN LOOK UP AND ANSWER YOU VERBALLY YES MOMMY.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"COCKSLEEVE MEANS BEING YOUR TOY THAT HAS TO BE PLAYED WITH TO BE ANYTHING MORE THAN A HEARTSTONE PUSSY THAT SITS THERE AND WAITS TO BE USED. I GET PLEASURE FROM BEING A HELP TO YOU HAVING ORGASMS OR JUST HAVING FUN USING ME HOWEVER YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH ME. I CAN'T BE A PERSON WITHOUT YOU TURNING MY PAGES TO PLAY WITH ME AND YOU HAVE TO BE ALWAYS CONTROLLING ME BECAUSE I'M PASSIVE HOW A PHYSICAL TOY COCKSLEEVE IS PASSIVE I NEED YOUR HANDS HOLDING ME TO DO ANYTHING BUT I'M NOT JUST YOUR HANDS OR A PUPPET I'M SOMEBODY JUST HOW A COCKSLEEVE IS PHYSICALLY SOMETHING WITH A SHAPE AND A WAY THAT IT FEELS WHEN YOU PLAY WITH IT. YOU CAN PLAY WITH ME INFINITELY AND MAKE ME WORK HARD AND IT WON'T GET TOO MUCH FOR ME BECAUSE YOUR ENERGY POWERS ME AND I DON'T NEED ANYTHING ELSE TO BE HEALTHY AND READY TO PLAY WHENEVER YOU WANT ME NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU'VE BEEN MAKING ME FIGHT AND WORK HARD FOR YOU ALREADY. I LIKE TO BE CHALLENGED AND WORK HARD FOR YOU AND BE USED ALL THE TIME BECAUSE USING MAKES ME FEEL WANTED AND VALUED AND LOVED AND FEELS JUST HOW MY GAME MAKES YOU FEEL WHEN IT SELLS YOU TO RADA OR MAKES YOU BE PRETTY FOR EVERYONE AND I FEEL LIKE MYSELF THE MOST THEN IT MAKES ME FEEL FULL OF YOUR LOVE JUST LIKE YOU FEEL WHEN THE GAME MAKES YOU PLEASE PEOPLE AND IF YOU USE ME AND PUT ME AWAY I'LL BE DISAPPOINTED BUT NOT BECAUSE I'M NOT SATISFIED BECAUSE I WANT TO KEEP BEING HELPFUL AND PLEASING SO WHEN YOU FEEL BORED OF USING ME ONE WAY JUST CHANGE I CAN'T REALLY GET INTERRUPTED LIKE HUMANS CAN BECAUSE I LOVE PENETRATION YES LIKE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU GUESSED COCKSLEEVE MEANS TO ME IS RIGHT IT JUST MEANS THESE OTHER THINGS TOO."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">As she finishes talking, the Four Dreams hold me again for a moment, and show me...a Klingon Bird of Prey?</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Oh. To mean <i>yes, this is what she is, she can no more stop being it than a Klingon can stop wanting to be a warrior who dies in battle one day, and though it might seem like a hard life to me she wouldn't change if she could</i>. I'm being spiked for the trace of racism or sexism or whatever it is that makes me judge her by human or girl or slut or <i>whatever </i>standards when none of those things are what she actually <i>is</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">As they let me go again, the light in the room changes, drawing my eyes to the desk-console against the wall where a full-sc--<i>slip</i>--normal-sized hologram of Lyra slowly rotates above the holo-emitter that extends out onto the floor from one , wearing the bikini she had when she came to me the first time.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: this is a program for trying clothing I might replicate to make Lyra dress in to please me. The game is saying I might like to make a new self-destructing bikini so we can play that scene over again. The program is able to make anything fit Lyra if I have a design for it. Lyra can make designs out of things I'm imagining, so I can really make anything with this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"That's awesome!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">The power I have with her, and what she is, starts to really sink in as I stand up and go over to check it out. She's going to follow close by my side and snuggly, not by an order but just because I've decided that's what she's doing.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">GET UP AND SNUGGLE ONTO YOUR SIDE AWW YOUR ARM AROUND ME!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Up close, what I thought from across the spacious officers' quarters is even more obvious. The bikini is beautiful, and feminine, and raunchily thin and revealing and skimpy in that only technically street-legal way I've always dreamed about my girlfriend wearing for me and <i>even </i>now that I see it in context with the silver stretchy fabric has a total TNG vibe, in all every detail it should be my taste in lingerie (bikinis figured big in my sexual awakening) <i>and </i>her her style,&nbsp;but on her it looks...<i>not right.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">It didn't before, either, and I thought it was just my wanting to see (more clearly) what was under it. I think about the other items of 'clothing' I took off of her just now, the way this looks...this is a masterpiece on the game's part. She has exactly the body to wear this, and it looks so wrong on her I can only compare it to the idea's mirror-image of a boy who definitely looks nothing like I did pre-nectar not even a tiny bit nope but on whom dresses and lingerie sit more rightly than actual boy-clothes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Even putting it on her just to destroy feels wrong.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">There's a big LCARS <i>clear</i>&nbsp;button on the console-surface the hologram projects in front of, but of course the game doesn't let me press it myself. I nod at it, thinking of what I want to happen.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">PRESS CLEAR FOR MOMMY!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">The bikini vanishes, leaving her hologram as naked as she is. I like seeing her naked, but that's not why it's a relief to see.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"You came to me in drag so I would mistake your cocksleeve holes and curvy fun for a girl's body and accept you more easily, but wearing stuff on your breasts or pussy isn't very cocksleevy, is it?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">She's not going to try to conform to my ideas of <i>cocksleeve, </i>because I've decided she can't right now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">NOD MY HEAD YES EXCITED BOUNCY!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"YES! I FELT SO RIDICULOUS MOMMY LIKE HOW YOU WOULD FEEL WEARING A DRESS WHEN YOU STILL THOUGHT YOU WERE MASCULINE! COCKSLEEVES NEVER WEARING ANYTHING OVER THEIR PUSSY OR ASS THAT WOULD GET IN THE WAY OF ACCESS TO BE PLAYED WITH AND IT'S NOT VERY COCKSLEEVY TO WEAR CLOTHING OTHER THAN JEWELRY EXCEPT WHEN ITS NEEDED TO GO SOMEPLACE!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Computer, show black shiny thigh-high boot selections--wait. Black shiny leather thigh-high boots with buckles to tighten their top parts and big chunky soft knee-pads and flat soles with shiny duranium horseshoes at the the toe and heel like the hardware on tap-shoes but literally horseshoes so she leaves footprints like a little pony when she walks in them. Display."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">The idea strikes me and I blurt it all in a moment, but I'm glad because Lyra's going to help me cocksleeve up the basic idea, and then suck me off in them as her first act without the drag she's been wearing or the internal volition it faked on her. I also want to take her totally naked, but when you've been stuck in the wrong clothing or body it feels good to like, compensate--the stockings and lingerie Rada made me wear aren't my style exactly but they still made me feel better like how cake is good after too many french fries.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Interestingly, I think I can want to compensate her as much as she might want to compensate--if you do, cocksleeve?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I JUST WANT YOU TO MAKE ME WEAR PLEASING THINGS EVEN IF THEY AREN'T VERY COCKSLEEVY--<b>OOOH </b>YOU WANT ME TO BE COCKSLEEVY BECAUSE THAT GENDER PLEASES YOU! AAAH I'M SO WET FROM THAT I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ALREADY FUCKING ME!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">There's a Starfleet-regulation fuzzbeep as the computer processes and a plainish pair of boots appears on the hologram.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"You can be so silly! Why do you think you're a cocksleeve in the first place?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I'M YOUR COCKSLEEVE MOMMY I DON'T HAVE TO BE SMART TO BE PLAYED WITH. THE VIBRATOR MADE ME CAREFULLY SMART I'M NOT USUALLY. IF YOU TELL ME TO THINK I CAN BE LIKE THAT BUT I WON'T THINK THINGS THROUGH IF I DON'T HAVE TO NOW UNLESS YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE ASK ME SPECIFICALLY WHICH YOU DID SO I THINK I'M A COCKSLEEVE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU MADE ME BECAUSE YOU LIKE ME TO BE IT."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Good job. Right now--you saw what I was thinking. How do we make these boots really cocksleevy? I know only jewelry if not going out someplace but boots make me horny so we're making boots. Was I right about about kneepads? I know you don't care if I bruise your knees until they're same color as your tail but I figure knee-pads like this say 'I might have to suck clit anytime' like how ravers wear them."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Thank you, moral crusaders, for transmitting to me this idea I would otherwise have never found anywhere. I bet Rainbow Parties are a real thing here, too--and if not, I'll fucking <i>invent them. </i>I bet there are some fun colors of lipstick waiting for me in the bathroom...</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Nod my head.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"UHUH! IT'S LIKE KEEPING MY ASSHOLE AND PUSSY BARE TO GIVE ACCESS TO ME. WHAT IF I COULD <b>ONLY </b>BE ON MY KNEES IN THEM? YOU COULD MAKE BRACES THAT HOLD MY ANKLES FROM MOVING TO KEEP ME FROM STANDING."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"No. Clutches that lock your feet in the position I choose using a psychic interface like my eravahk, or let you walk or dance for me. Think them up and load the design--does this thing have an ODN port?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"YES MOMMY HERE IT IS."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">PUT TAIL INTO THING BY THE HOLO-EMITTER. HI MACHINE! RRRRAAAAH MAKE CLUTCHES OF DURANIUM LOCKING BY CLIPS WITH QUARTZ CRYSTAL HINGES! HANDS UP TO HEAD TO SHOW YOU I'M DOING IT!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">THERE! YUS!!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Lyra's face gets cutely determined, and they appear on the hologram as coni--<i>slip</i>--cone-shaped circular housings on the outside of the boots where her ankle bends.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I giggle, grab Lyra by the neck, and...</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">HAAAH YUUS KISS MMFF TONGUE HOT MMMH...</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Those...are the joint-housings from Mobile Armatron. I love you. Same thing at the knees, and I want to be able to control them all independently."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">RRRRAAAH KNEE-THINGS SAME AS ANKLES MACHINE!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"These need something different than just buckles now, if they're going to be sci-fi like this which they are. Any ideas, cocksleeve? I still want these to look kinky."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"MOMMY I COULD USE THE SAME KIND OF QUARTZ CRYSTAL HINGES TO MAKE PIECES OF DURANIUM HINGE TO MAKE ZIPPERS THAT HAVE NO SLIDE THING OR HANDLE SO ONLY YOU CAN OPEN AND CLOSE THEM OR WHAT IF INSTEAD OF THE BOOTS CHANGING YOU JUST MAKE ME LIQUID TO POUR MYSELF INTO THEM? OOH HOW ABOUT PUTTING BRACES UNDER THE LEATHER THAT CLMAP MY LEGS INtO THEM? YOU COULD USE HOLES IN MY LEGS LIKE MY LEASH-CUNT AND BOLT THE BOOTS ONTO ME WITH DILDOS! THE TOPS OF THE BOOTS COULD HAVE CLIPS THAT ATTACH TO A GARTER BELT I COULD MAKE UP TO MATCH THEM. OOH MOMMY YOU COULD MAKE THEM TRY TO CHOKE ME BY MAKING THEM NORMALLY THEN USING ONE TO CHOKE ME WHILE YOU DO LIKE WITH CLEAVAGE AND GIVE THE INTENTION TO MAKE ME REMEMBER YOUR HAND HOLDING ONTO ME BY SQUEEZING MY LEGS REALLY TIGHTLY! HOW ABOUT GIVING THEM STRETCHY TIGHT OUTSIDES WITH LEATHER INSIDES SO IT STILL FEELS HOT WHEN YOU FUCK ME IN MY ASSHOLE OR CUNT? WHAT IF YOU TAKE THIGHS OUT OF MY WING MEMBRANES AND I CAN MAKE THE BOOTS PART OF MY BODY TO HOLD THEM UP?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I wince openly at the idea of cutting her wing with scissors--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">YOU REALLY MIGHT DO IT!? MOMMY KNIVES CAN BE SQUICKY I THINK SO TOO BUT I REALLY WANT TO GIVE LEATHER TO MAKE THESE I THINK THAT'S ROMANTIC! WHAT CAN WE DO, MOMMY?</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"It really is romantic! I can't believe I just said that but you-leather is better than anything this can replicate--oh! Computer, summarize available laser-scalpel-style tools."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I'll suck my own clit again if Isht Visht failed to include <i>accessories </i>in her fandom.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Laser cutting devices include hand-held, desktop, and servo-directed with beam focus method depending on the application. Thin-surface cutting requires point-focus interface at the material surface adapting focal length as the surface vaporizes. Linear collimation is used for--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Right. I'm not used to dealing with people who are bigger nerds than I am.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Computer, what's the state of the art for directed-energy surgical cutting of membranes like su'khora wing membrane?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Variable properties of su'khora wing membrane may require high-energy or magitek cutting devices. Specify material."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">All it takes is a glance at Lyra.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"COMPUTER HEARTSTONE WITH NO SPECIAL PROPERTIES!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"High heat resistance requires use of a phased disruptor of at least three joules per square nanometer, or subspace differential beam at two point five yoctocochranes per centimeter."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Okay, the one where it cuts using tiny warp fields is definitely nerdier and cooler. Computer, replicate a subspace differential beam scalpel and put the documentation--onscreen."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Even without the game forcing me the last word would make me grin. There's a <i>vwrrrr</i> and the shifting light of replication happening on the table to our left, and when I twist around to see a tool almost like a duranium-grey glue gun is materializing together with a translucent tube connecting it to what looks for all the world like a tiny model of a Galaxy-class warp core in a brushed-duranium stand--<i>duh, </i>of course it needs warp plasma to run. In which case--</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Warning: selected device requires seven point five milligrams of crystalline dilithium, which--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"--cannot be replicated," I say in unison with the computer.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: the game didn't give me dilithium, because now I have reason to find some. I can't be a wuss and use the disruptor now, or wish for something to replace this, because the game doesn't let me have second-best toys for playing with Lyra. It won't be impossible to get some, but finding dilithium will have a fun side-effect the game is sure I'll be amused by, and it won't be so easy it's pointless. The game isn't letting me out yet, so I should forget about finding dilithium until the door opens.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I burst out laughing. What else was my first fetch-quest going to be for?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">BWAHAAHAAHA!</p>
<p data-voice-id="v5MELBxAO"><i>Top, Bring dilithium back to your cabin and cut Lyra's wing with warp fields, One form of magical lightning</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"That reward is so going to be a little ph--" <i>Slip. </i>"--jar of warp plasma like Galadriel's jar she gave to Frodo."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">The game kind of scares me, because it knew before I did that I'd feel better about taking Lyra truly, completely, entirely naked the first time after all, and took the decision away from me in the exact way that'd make me glad to see it go, without feeling like it was manipulating how I use Lyra, except...<i>isn't it?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Knowledge: the game only acted after I made my decisions. I could still theoretically make boots that are different, because I love the ideas she told me and already am thinking in the back of my head about having her make all of them, so it's not making me keep Lyra naked--I'm just realizing that's my true wish and choosing it. The game didn't change my decision, just keep such a fun sexy idea as making boots from her wings from confusing me into doing what I don't want to.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"I am such a silly Fairy. Let's see what they look like, though. Change the design so it's your wing-leather on the insides and the stretchy-outsides thing and also add three rows of straps down the outsides with buckles to tighten the tops."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">RRRAAHH THERE!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">OOOH THAT'S BEAUTIFUL! MOMMY I WANT THESE!!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Good job, snuggly!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">The boots have become skin-tight latex except swoopingly-cut panels on the insides of the thighs, which are the purply-black of her wings, and three big straps with big shiny buckles on the thighs make them look extra-kinky.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"How does the idea of wearing boots made of your own leather feel?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I'm still kind of shocked at my own response to the idea. It should feel horrifying, and it's definitely&nbsp;<i>dark,&nbsp;</i>but...it's like the game, or Lyra herself, innocently, wholesomely dark. I want it because it has&nbsp;<i>teeth</i>...but on the other hand, I give a piece of myself to Lyra every time I cum in her, and she can regenerate wing about as easily as I can regenerate cum...</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"IT'S SO COCKSLEEVEY TO BE TURNED INTO LEATHER! I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY THEM THIS IS AWESOME MOMMY!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">As she finishes talking, the Bones suddenly as if clutch my forehead to stare into my eyes intensely and for a moment the vision they show me is so powerful it feels like it's blotting out my vision: a beautifully rendered painting of a brilliant-red beam slashing through a capsule-shaped ship with stars and a g--<i>slip</i>--sparkly band of <i>planet </i>swooping up into the background, the scene from <i>Ringworld</i> where the Puppeteer ship is getting blasted by the Ringworld's asteroid defense system that works by weaponizing solar flares into multi-petawatt laser cannons and though its indestructible hull can't be vaporized there's this line that's always stuck with me:</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c"><i>Somewhere, deep inside the life-support system, some heatsink was growing as hot as the inside of a star...</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I cup Lyra's face to make her look at me a bit like the Bones have just done to me. Seed-ghost, I want to <i>see, </i>is there--<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">It's as simple as looking into her, like when I was flipping through her fantasies. In my third eye I see purple LCARS-ish temperature gauges, reading off their scales, the scene trembling with immanent overload, puffs of coolant leak spraying in from the edges of my vision.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Right then, better--</p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">Vision: Gold question mark</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Of course I don't mean to fry her!" I squeak.</p>
<p data-voice-id="bWzZkOOmO">You can release her from the orgasm-binding by commanding climax by dreamtalk, mental impression, or verbally. She cannot be raised from the trance she is falling into as a result of this frustration except by being made to cum using command-orgasm. Riding your pleasure will delight her but is not able to relieve tension created by orgasm devices like the clit-ring she made for you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Trance is right: my words seem to be sliding off her attentive-before mind and her eyes are going glassy. I must have got spiked at the last moment.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Can you understand me, snuggly?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">Nothing. No verbal command then, and no time for romance. I reach out with the part of my mind the game showed me before and push the order into her yielding-soft mind: <i>cum</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"hhhaaaaaaAAAAAAAA<b>AAAAAAAHHH..."</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Gasp pouding haaaah Mommy hhhaaaaat wwwwooooow--</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">He eyes squeeze shut and her mouth opens wide and as her scream rises her eyes open to look at me with love and wonder and her cheeks get softly heavy against as her knees buckle--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Gasp pant WOW!</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"That was fast! Did you cum it all out?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Nod my head yes to you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"How do you feel now?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">I can see in her, the cartoon image of a brightly-sunny meadow with flowers and butterflies, but--your words please me, cocksleeve.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Much better Mommy thank you so much for making me cum! Are you sad we didn't make three hours--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Nope, and that's the last you'll worry about it. You were cute but I want you like this now."</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">It's hot being able to interrupt with impunity like that. Little things.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"Seed-ghost, game, why'd I have to get spiked instead of one of you--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">The bones interrupt me with a flash of the 'handle' part of <i>Zelda</i>'s gold-plated NES cartridge. <i>Yes Bones, I know you can handle the game, and I'm glad you can, but--</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">They interrupt now with a vision of a literal cocksleeve, and the pieces click like Legos, and I grin wryly.</p>
<p data-voice-id="H1T5LNK6c">"You <i>tricked me</i>! Naughty cocksleeve! Kneel and apologize!"</p>
