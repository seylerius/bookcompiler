<article class="chapter 79---mother-of-god">
    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">79 - Mother of God</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My outfit's there! It's hanging over the side of the chair with the presents, and I was too busy crushing Lyra and ogling the presents to see it (what's with her name why do Lyra and Meldoy both feel weird I bet that answer is in the other room too I go to the living room in Arlington when I think about it).</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Game I didn't see my black pumps and I can't wear stockings with my Dynasty shoes. Are the pumps somewhere?&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Did you see them, handmaiden?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I saw them in the closet with your stockings when your light came back so I bet they're on the floor right here, Princess. If you roll me I can look for you but please don't let me go I don't think I can take it yet."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My purse is hanging there too, still full of cum probably. The thought makes me smile, brings me a little silliness.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Oh don't worry, you're not going anywhere. This hug really might be forever...anyway I'm sure they're there."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's a sense down in my stomach like something tickling or expanding. What the fuck is happening? It keeps on getting bigger, doesn't feel unpleasant, turns into an icy cold--brainfreeze agh what is this!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess it's my gum it must be but I don't know what it's doing!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Haahah COLD!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It just keeps getting bigger, pushing up my passage into my deep-throat place and feeling kind of sexy even though it's freezing. It fills me nice and tightly full without expanding to be painful or make the game transform my body, and <i>pops</i> with a fun burst of sexy pressure!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It makes me gasp and giggle--so silly!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Bwahaha it blew a bubble! That was hot--I mean cold--okay why cold, just for fun?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Oh probably. You know I'm mostly silly fun not things with big deep meanings. Princess what's that frilly white stuff on your package with the rainbow stripes? It looks just like the horny-pleasure thing from Starlight Princess!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"What was that...RRR my memory is still so wrecked!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The present she's talking about looks like it's surrounded by a halo of nectar or cum, glowing out from behind the box. It's cute and sexy, anyway, and makes me curiouser.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Remember sexy things would have that all around them when they made someone feel horny pleasure? There must be something good in there!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Idea, horny royal advisor! How do we get that open without letting go of each other?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"We could shapeshift me an extra arm to reach it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"And that arm will instantly do what no matter what order I give you except I won't be able to command anything but <i>hug me</i>&nbsp;right now?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I can't be good right now you're right I need to hold on every way I can so if you give me extra anything it'll just keep hugging you no matter what you say to me."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Wait, duh! Game, tentacle that box over here and hold it so we can unwrap it with our teeth!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The game picks up the box and carefully slides the top ones off of it, then holds it up above the bed where she and I can each get a corner.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Together, watch me for your cue. Rar!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">With a cutesy snarl I bite the paper on my corner.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Bwhaha raah! Errrgh grab teeth tight pulling tearing off the paper nice sexy slowly raraahgrah!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I tear and tug at my corner, careful not to soak the paper and make it un-bitable. It rips from the middle, instead, and after a few pulls I have my half of it free and <i>ptui-</i>ed to the pillows behind me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It looks like Legos for a moment and that wouldn't be <i>that</i>&nbsp;hard to get us to see the pleasure-thing for, but no...</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Gaaaasp "That's a nice toybag what's inside it looks like sewing tools and leather tools and chain and wire tools Princess I can make you anything with this!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A black leather kind of bookbag with a rainbow flap (made beautifully out of different-colored leather, not a print) is the star of a box for what otherwise looks like a Lego set. The tools are laid out on the cover, showing what it comes with, and--oh my god I can have her decorate my entire room in handmade Starlight Princess stuff, and do themed bondage gear, and...did she handmake all that sexy stuff she always wore?&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">No that's right. We made Disney pay for it to be custom tailored, every stitch.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"You can fix my Dynasty shoes! If we can cut some wing leather you can make pumps out of them, can't you?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Looking at the tools in here...yes! Nod excited bouncy yes!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Kiss you on the head for being so loyally eager to serve, handmaiden. Her face just about breaks in half with the happy grin she wears, excited to be helpful even if it hurts to cut her wing membranes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">If I was normal girl I'd keep the Dynasty shoes like they are for sparkly dresses or going naked with, and wear my pumps with my Starlight Princess outfit that's hanging on the chair right there, but I am not a normal girl.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Sewing leather onto their frames won't hurt them, or make it impossible to get them back the way they are now if I decide I want them, and I'm defintely going to have plenty of both sparkly dresses and nakedness in places where you want fancy shoes, but I want them every day and there's a reason my seedling is hentai.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I am too, and everyone knows cartoon characters always wear the same outfit. Just being naked has ruled, but I can't wait to get back into it. I can't wait to get back to being <i>me</i>. To being <i>us.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Weird weepyness comes over me as I realize just how changed everything is.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"What does being us <i>mean </i>now, advisor? That life we just remembered was everything!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I think you forgot a lot of things, Princess. You can't remember our private time, I see you."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She's right, because the hunger that's been trying stuff the memories of our showbiz career inside me all at once like a too-big dildo instantly switches to pining for <i>that.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Dripping melted gummibears I must be missing half my soul. Is that really the last piece with our little selves?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The swear takes effort, is a choice I have to make. Being silly feels <i>so good, is ME</i>, but it's <i>work. </i>Did I always just choose it every moment, or is it hard because I'm still missing pieces? WHO CARES LET IT <i>BE</i>&nbsp;WORK I'LL DO IT <i>BECAUSE</i>&nbsp;IT HURTS IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO BE ME.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I know this is the end of the stomry part. Everything that's painful hard and scary happened all at once and now that part is over. There might be lots more things like this piece left waiting but they won't have big bad scary things just things like playing Legos."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Tears well up and I start crying as she talks because it seems so impossible. I won't do it right, I'll mess it up or just not be able to...everything else scared me too but now there's nothing to fight just the fear of trying to imagine and not being able to. I want to use the swear <i>heavy cotton panties</i>&nbsp;because it feels like I'm wearing some but there's no spot for it and that somehow sums everything up perfectly.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A vision from the Dreams of myself in my pretty rainbow getup from season one or two of Starlight Princess makes me cry even harder.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">No wait, that's a squishie poofy doll in silky fabric I demanded. Yes, we had merch, Lyra made an adorable pony plushie, and isn't that kind of what Fairies are I feel like a doll a lot I wish I could feel more like one without falling into that whole puppet abyss but I don't think my game leaves one bit of that joy ungiven so...that isn't your point, is it Dreams--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh. My tears get quiet as I remember, or try to, and then flood out again, more pathetic and heartbroken. It hurts <i>so much </i>it's worse than all the other ones put together and the mercy of this ship and bed is Lyra and the Dreams saying that if it really is just too much and I just can't ever face it we can just stay here hugging like this for eternity which is what I'll be able to do if I can't face this that's <i>okay</i>&nbsp;we'll just stay here forever.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There was never anything <i>bad</i>. My parents believed in imaginative play to the point they must have spent every spare cent and a lot that <i>weren't </i>spare&nbsp;on stuff like Legos, my brothers were always there with absurd scenarios and playing along, <i>I </i>was the one who couldn't do it and I knew that the whole time. It was like a fire that couldn't catch, just like it couldn't catch while I was watching Lyra with our little selves, I could imagine going over there and explaining how I had my own oxygen because Lyra's hair made it like in <i>A Swiftly Tilting Planet</i>&nbsp;but that would have been one more spark that didn't light things and I felt like it was just <i>so hard </i>trying to keep the imagination going I couldn't do it even seeing the possibility of thinking about it hurt too much.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Alright <i>heavy cotton panties </i>it's horrifying to feel this sense of jammed gears and be happy becuase I <i>found something</i>. The whole course I've been sailing since Ten Forward and that thing about pink Legos is the one around this jam.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">What in the name of north-pole candycanes <i>is</i>&nbsp;this? I <i>just </i>knew and now it's gone.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We really must be stuck forever because this is where I usually blow something up and--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me a heart-shaped house like a giant candy with windows and a door.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Heart home. Heart home why what does that mean something Legos dolls seer help me I can't see what to do here what are they telling us?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess listen. Lego bricks make anything, can't they? Why don't we make a heart-house? Just because we always had blue and grey spaceship parts doesn't me we have to make one! Come on, just pretend the color's right!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She's right and my arms can let go now but they don't because something else is jammed just <i>move</i>&nbsp;self come <i>on.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I won't be able to do it I won't be able to play and imagine maybe build it but that isn't the <i>point</i>&nbsp;the house isn't isn't--rainbows--the sight of that doll fills my mind happy--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Jammed paralysis but I keep seeing rainbows.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Rainbows jumble-colored legos with a lot of black colors glowing in the dark neon markers on black glass the glow of a black mirrror with lots of people talking--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me a rainbow-sheening stone with a hole in it like it could be a pendant. Dreamer's stone from the Five Pointed Star it lead to other worlds it lead to the Four Dreams but the Four Dreams aren't for kids they--I--sick quooziness struggling against myself--Starlight Princess was about how to imagine imagination was the key to implanting <i>and </i>the Four Dreams but you also just need it to be alive so--more sick quooziness all the parts were were were&nbsp;<i>missing </i>maybe I could imagine the colors were right but I could never find <i>what to imagine</i>&nbsp;that's what we were <i>doing</i>&nbsp;with the show and our performances and everything that was the whole drama fuck is that the premise of the show or the Starlight Princess' current drama ARGH this is <i>fixed</i> now inspiration is all around me and here in my <i>arms&nbsp;</i>why can't I can't I--weird visions roil, blue and grey Legos just two pieces, Flash, my Earth-mom the worldgate closing forever with its weird anti-light explosion why that now--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess I can help you listen Heart Home is our house from Starlight Princess that we lived in please just make it with me out of anything use these tools we got if you want just imagine it's Lucy Starlight's castle like your Earth mom had Strawberry Fortress just imagine that much you <b>can </b>imagine that much I see you thinking what would Lucy Starlight have in her house candy sexy fun that's what!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Suddenly I understand the two very serious kids sitting in the other room and cry so bitterly it feels like it'll break me into a million pieces.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"What--what are those in the other room. I thought they were like, dolls or something, but they're not, right? Is that actually us somehow?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"That's you and me the last time we played like you can't remember now, Princess. They're us but not like carried here or journeying. It lets us muse just to you and me back through time to Arlington."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"HOW ARE YOU SO KIND," I wail, crying so it feels like I'll squeeze out every drop of water in me down my cheeks.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">When I couldn't take one more journey, not even to Arlington to play Legos, she brought the place I needed to go to me, and gave me eternity to prepare if I needed it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I might need it. I lay there hugging her and crying for a long time more.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I spent my life trying to inspire people, playing songs of paradise on Lyra to try and show people the way there. It's shadowy but I can remember enough, feel it, to walk in those high-heeled shoes as far as I need to, as it were.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I hope. It's weird to think my greatest challenge will be <i>myself. </i>I'm not sure even the Starlight Princess will be able to reach me there, but she's damn well going to try.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"If you can follow my command to let go of me, handmaiden, it's time for you to dress me."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A little hope warms my heart as I tell her, and maybe a bit of that iron fist I seem to have inherited from my mothers. I'm the <i>Starlight Princess</i>. We'll see what color those spirally Legos are when I'm through with them.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess I'm ready as long as you take me back here for more holding after this."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"You have no idea how much that's the plan."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This time I'll believe she and my game and the Dreams are as kind as they've been trying to tell me without asking. We <i>will </i>be able to still stay here eternally after this if we want.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It still feels hard to give the order, so I wait a good long time.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: how to muse spaceships into Heart Home will be obvious when I get there. I just have to get dressed and put myself in their world with them.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay. If it's really that easy that helps so much.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Okay. You have to dress me but you can be just as clingy as feels good when it doesn't keep you from doing that. Take a last hard squeeze and then we're getting out of bed together."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">RRRRRAAAAAAAH SQUEEZE! RRR CRUSHED--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Eravahk, make your leash <i>heavy.</i>"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Omifuck yes sexy hot wet keep me chained and near you!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The leash transforms from girly (if big for what it is) jewelry chain into a big fat chain-up-your-dragon chain, but stays rainbow-shiny. I can feel just the few links off the bed pulling on my eravahk.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"A little something extra for the extra clingy mood. Okay, here we go, up."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">With surprising smoothness we manage to get standing without letting go of each other. Mercifully, the outfit and chair are <i>right</i>&nbsp;there.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"It's time for the Starlight Princess' comeback. Stockings first, handmaiden."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Ulp here you go letting go but leash is super heavy big and you're not getting away I'll say you said get Princess back and jump grab snuggle right back to here.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Don't forget you have a tail to grab me with."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">With that, I squeeze her, and put my arms by my sides.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Let you go tail grab onto anything please stay out of the way--yes around waist super fast eep Princess I hurt you I'm sorry!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Her tail whips up around my waist so fast it cracks like a whip and stings when it hits, reminding me that sometimes a little pain is just the thing for emphasis--so don't be sorry, handmaiden.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes Princess. Get your stockings kneel and wait for foot--raise right one, slide sexy hands inside the top up your leg snuggly work it right to the end.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My heart hovers in strange suspense as she works, like I won't believe this until the whole outfit is on me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Ulpsnif so much familiar happiness I'm handmaiden it's back I did it my Princess is making me put on her Starlight socks like she always did!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Next leg I'm ready here we go uuuup fingers inside to snuggle your leg nice and sexy up stretch make sure everywhere is smooth right with hands all up and down your legs hehe Princess likes that one!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Giggles! "Make sure you check everywhere!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes Princess I'm thorough see triple check every part of you!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This cuteness is worth letting go of her for all by itself, and I'm horny enough to throw her over the bed and have her right in the middle of dressing me, but...too many emotions.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Now pop my clit off and the game will store it. It gets a nice sexy kiss first."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Gasp clit kissing slowly make my lips shine with fresh nectar look up at you while I lick them squeeze them tight to make sure it spreads good and uuup and kiss myself on nice and soft wet hold my eyes onto your eyes while I have you inside me just a bit but that's still sex if you ask me--awww headpets Princess you have me don't be scared I won't be lost no matter what happens that's done now I'll always be with you!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">When I put my hands on her, visions of that time come over me, the fateful day at the park losing Spiral Nicker, preschool before Spiral Nicker the ache of abandonment to a room full of kids who hated me--why these now? I don't understand, do I need to? <i>Should </i>I understand, game?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Gently, I fuzz her a last time and move my hands so she can finish.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Slllurp sexy off look up and wait you're not sure again.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowldge: Spiral Nicker was real to me. She was Lyra. After I lost her, I couldn't bring myself to play that way anymore. In preschool I had the strange fantasy of having my head cut off and left with only my organs wrapped up in plastic. I had that because I was already feeling the ache of boy stories making my heart feel sad. Just cut this off I don't want it, was what I was saying.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>Oh.</i> Strawberry swizzle-sticks. When we made live Dreamskins, I still had a surprise under my skirt, but she had to...get its attention (not that that was hard, until it <i>was</i> about three seconds later, bwaha).&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The suction-cup thing is <i>so useful</i>&nbsp;but maybe...not this time. If I even <i>can</i>? I <i>will</i>, I can carry this and still be the Starlight Princess, just like I did before.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Relax, clit. Playtime's coming again soon. Ever so slowly, it lays itself against my legs, soft and silky. It'll stay until something <i>interesting</i> enough happens, but only barely. It should do for this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess I'll be very careful--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Nope, you'll be <i>even more </i>sexy.&nbsp;I'll get soft again when you finish."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Sweet I can make you hard like I used to! I thought that was gone!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Nope! Skirt is next."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Take skirt--it's one piece Princess there's just this dress. Hold it out for you to see it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's the one-piece, long-sleeved frilly black satin princess dress from when I was a kid, which is right for this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Put it on me."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">STand up please arms up wait--up there we go now bound on my wings up to get it over your head and put your arms into each hole nice and smooth and fast and sllliiide my hands down your sides to put the dress on as I land on my feet again. Adjust it make sure the wrinkles gone there comes your clit hehe!&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"There's a reason I call you <i>hand</i>maiden."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Bwaha grabby squish make your breasts fit most exactly into the chest of this!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The happy lust of her obediently handsy service starts to bring my light up, making my stockings glow and shining through my dress like stars. Unlike my grown-up outfit, petticoats spread my light out to turn the whole skirt into a night sky that shines with thousands of tiny white star-holes.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now the Fox(!) library near our house in Arlington like the visions of Preschool and losing Spiral Nicker. I understand this one even less than the other two.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: this was my birthday that year. Olympic Pizza (across from the Library), walking back home, cherry coke in my hand, resting my hand on the can top because the cold felt good. Spiral Nicker's not here yet and Freddie is back in Presque Isle. Where's my friend, then? Riding on top of the pizza box! She always got where I would look most, just in case I would see her. I'm seeing this now because the library and trees and stop sign we what my two eyes had in their sight-line as my third eye caught a glimpse her leaping up onto the pizza as my dad took it off of the counter and carried it out of the door facing the library.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My heart races as the unset broken bone of <i>knowing </i>I saw that and having no way to integrate it even into my imaginary world heals. Eep--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--the fantasy I had at that age of diving into the TV screen and charging off up the cable to lands of adventure, but instead of having a random lion for a companion I'm riding Lyra in pony-form down the TV-static tunnel at lightspeed--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--drawing pictures of the dock at Grand Lake with the moon over the water in MacPaint but now Lyra is sitting there because I can see her, sitting on the floor with her back to me to model looking up at the moon so I can carefully click the right pixels on to capture her shape--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--playing with SkyCommanders with their ribbons and strings, there she is smiling through the maze of them, this is so fun!--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--staring at an artificial horizon, her pretty silver hair and horns in the foreground just like piloting the Waifu: we're playing A-10 Attack! together--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--I'm watching her flapping up trailing the long green extension cord to hang (what was the name of the holiday argh it was Christmas but not Christmas and not Xmas either) lights high in the trees in front of our house, I'm gleeful to show off our flying family member this way and she looks so pretty in the air--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--sitting across the table from me in some restaurant or another, intent on a cellphone because we're using it to pass notes, she's wearing some big fleece-lined jacket, it makes her look cute and cozy--her hand with mine on the handle of the cookie-gun making spritzer cookies for our wedding, the lined table cloth around the plate, her naked presence <i>so good</i>&nbsp;beside me, we were home alone and bareassed to make cookies together (and fuck in the kitchen while they baked...)--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--she's standing, tail plugged into the zipdrive, concentrating cutely as she fills the disk with the wedding mixtape Isht Visht made us and is now dreamtalking her bit by bit--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--white gloves on my hands, I'm naked but there are people&nbsp;<i>holy undertones this is our wedding I can't breathe</i>&nbsp;she's standing smily and excited naked with her hands behind her back, she kneels at my feet--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">...where she is when I blink out of the rush of memory-visions. I still can't really breathe, gasp for air.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>That was our wedding.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Gaaaaaaaaaasp "YOU REMEMBER I SAW YOU I WAS GIVING MYSELF AND YOU SAW ME KNEEL DOWN!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Beat my hands on my knees too excited to keep still!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"EEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I reach a hand down to her head, but can't do anything but stand there panting for a long while. Even tears won't come, it's..not <i>like </i>that it's like the same shock as losing a limb going the opposite direction.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--my leg up on a chair with my rainbow stocking shining (if they stay on for sex they <i>definitely </i>stay on for my wedding) and the silvery garter she's slowly working off to be hurled into the crowd and find out who's the next to implant by getting whacked with a dreamskin from afar like Jesus did--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I <i>just </i>remembered how I swear and got sticky with it, but there's really only one swear you can say here:<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>"Mother of god."</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="v5MELBxAO"><i><strike>Top, Learn the seed-pod the savior of the demons came from, juice that breaks bread with his disciples</strike></i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><b>WHAT!? </b>Oh my fuck I'm not born exactly but I sure have made seeds with you all over Earth with the Strawberry Church&nbsp;and all that Disney stuff and it does make sense from how the Dreams made Jesus implant while we fixed seeing me in the doorway <b>AAAH I MADE JESUS' DREAMSKIN!!!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--the Implantation window over the altar at St. John's glowing bright with sun in the dark church, the Dreamskin over Jesus' head so obvious now: a silver demon femme with stars all around her kneeling and submissively holding out an overflowing cup, the long-searched-for Grail he would...never describe in anything but...metaphor...SWIRLY METAPHYSICAL CUMSTICKS--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">BWAHAHAHAAHA OMIFUCK PRINCESS IT's YOUR <b>PURSE </b>THE GRAIL IS YOUR <b>PURSE</b> WITH YOUR CLIT CUMMING EVERYWHERE BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--the sound of engine and brakes as the tour bus rolls into the church parking lot in Bangor, that thrill of <i>Maine </i>in the air like we've come home just a bit, she's on the stairs just inside the door completely bareassed and looking so pretty from behind waving to everyone out the window with her tail lashing in full demon-mode. Even here we drew a gaggle of fans and hopeful heartformers, that one catgirl even with beautiful fake paws I could only imagine she hoped would be real soon, leaning out from the crowd to wave, the smell of burgers already in my nose as I anticipate the fancy cookout we're about to set up (spared no expense!) and all my plans to fuck people's minds with Lyra's fireproof flesh and ability to replicate the fast-food burger of your choice, without using a spatula--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--Lyra still naked sitting cross-legged on the cushions while I lie on my side behind her in my sexy Starlight Princess outfit, watching as she reads cards and pulls visions for our current client. It's twilight and citronella torches make our pavillion nice and numinous, and there's a nice long line of querents: the church is doing a fundraiser and we're helping by selling farseeing readings from <i>the </i>Melody and the real Starlight Princess...but as usual we've set the whole thing up as a Dreamskin you can come right up and ogle for free, and people are, and pictures of us will be everywhere soon--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--snuggled together in a seat, booting up a game of StarFox CD on the bus' PlayStation, Lyra grabs a controller so we can play co-op (Nintendo didn't need to ask where Lyra and I would be if they failed to include a real co-op mode) and as we start loading up the bridge that marks the end of 95 shoots past outside the window, we're almost to Presque Isle now--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--the Rainbow Temple in Mars hill from my childhood lined with flowers and decorations but in the road ahead of the bus a crowd of locals come to welcome their princess and her seedling back to Aroostook County. There are, as always, a ton of stairs up to the entrance, we're waving out the front of the bus and I'm holding Lyra to me in front of me with an arm under her breasts--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"How...they <i>welcomed us back...</i>"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Weepy shock makes the world seem unsteady, how could beloved but conservative Aroostook County roll out a red carpet like that for our buses full of debauchery and kinky antics with Lyra's bare <i>everything </i>smiliing and waving out the windshield, to say nothing of the rest of the trip across Maine? YES I WANTED MY HOME BACK BUT HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess remember how heartforming gave you advantages? Everyone wanted their kid to implant, they would let us do anything if they thought it would help them, even stuff like go naked and parade all around like in Bangor.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A sick knot of delusional-feeling self-importance unties inside me: yes, we took down Disney and did it after our own particular idiom with my game giving us that candyslicing <i>cinematic </i>court win, but that's just what happened to you if you went up against a seed-ghost, not me being some kind of unstoppable chosen one. The way I was special was that I happened to be a princess from another world, and they got stupid trying to capitalize on that without going through with the shift in corporate identity and goals our seed-ghost made them agree to when the time came--it wrote the contract, dreamtalking terms in kid-speak through me, making me seem like an easy mark I suppose. Seed-ghosts that were left alone to heartform in peace slotted seamlessly into society, giving advantage without stepping on others and protecting their charges. Seed-ghosts that were betrayed, broke nations in half, literally in the case of southwest Republican Nevada and Arizona, where people came to escape what they saw as an invasion from outside the universe and made public displays of su'khora illegal...for fifteen minutes, <i>exactly</i>, to the microsecond, and then a heartforming member of their legislature described the wording embedded in paragraphs referencing parts of the law in succession that gave absolute authority over the exact definition of <i>public displays</i>&nbsp;to heartformers and their su'khora in the moments in question. To enforce the new law, police would have to ask those they were arresting if they defined their activities as illegal! All he had done was object at the right set of moments, and created the self-destruct out of their bickering. That caused a spate of secessions, each leaving state mysteriously able to dance out of the union without a second of bloodshed, only to find out when they were done with it that seed-ghosts had helped them escape and kept their people from violence, set up a way to deport heartformers back to America, and made laws that made it illegal to keep them there. Families torn asunder, read the headlines, but it drew out the true motivation, to be able to stop heartforming children, and adults if they had the chance, as if su'khora lives meant less than human ones--a hard place to stand, for countries that gave abortion the capital punishment! They all had this in their constitution, but again had escape clauses that required the states to pay to transport women who asked for it outside their borders and give them the means to obtain one--except that only meant something for humans, since nowhere existed that would help you end your heartforming! That was between seed-ghost, su'khora, and heartformer, but no-one ever went through with it, because a seed-ghost is the image of its heartformer from infinite time down their timeline, deciding their past self should heartform. If it happens at all, your fate is decided. Nothing can stop or erase that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The fate of those states was staggering. In fifteen short days they had become independent, set up deporation programs, started the process to use them, moved not one single person except some emergency abortions that couldn't wait for the process to send them abroad to start functioning, when it all came crashing down in one hour as Washington declared each state in violation of the Human Rights of the families who lived there because of the deportation policies separating parents from children. Those easy fast exits were built on a treaty that secured human rights as defined by the UN Human Rights Commission, and reverted the land to America if any violations existed in the view of the Human Rights Commission, making the new state militaries and governments into militia and guilty of treason.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That was the end of it, just like Starlight Princess being thirteen eternally (they wouldn't even go into my teenage years, let alone make the series Gainax did) was the end of my story. I watched on the news as heartformers came by the thousands to wish mercy for the states' high officials, at the behest of their seed-ghosts, with signs and petitions, to show that they didn't wish death on them, still the penalty for treason in those days. All of this was the diversion, though. In those fifteen days, the suddenly left-leaning, pro-LGBT, pro-heartforming House and Senate (all the most vehement opponents of these having gone to the rogue states) passed the "Contract with Satan" (as conservatives called it, and ironic-minded liberals like me) that established seed-ghosts collectively as a state-level actor in treaty with America, and promised freedom for heartformers to do things like I did with Lyra in exchange for ensuring world peace through American policy and the economic success necessary to make that happen. It wasn't just a blank check, though. Heartformers had to carefully step around children (nobody's kids were there at the churches) and America had to be steward, not lord, of the world it was given--and if somebody else made the same kind of deal as America, they would gain equal standing. Most of the world followed suit in a heartbeat. Everything changed in weeks then, and that was the world I grew up in.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"How did I end up like this, then," the game makes me whine, though I am wondering. Also, why now with this, did I just put back enough to remember all that and need to go through it that way? The game's been picking my thoughts to make me remember each part of it. IT'S HARDLY THE MOMENT!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me just me, not even hentai, and give me a sense of my own presence as others feel it that makes me feel so beautiful I want to cry for a year, then a cartooish skull, kindly abstract, but the meaning is obvious.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I've known, I think, the whole time, but still I weep and yank Lyra upright to hug me, crushing her with everything.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Am...you would know you could tell am I...is this...transporters you understand me...<i>and either way cocksleeve am I RIGHT </i>did you get the right <i>me </i>back..."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess hug you I'm staying here don't worry I'll hug you like this for eternity if you don't stop me!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess I'm hugging you for eternity that's what I say if you ask if you're right for me. You're the same conscious light-being you were when I implanted and you lived in the Strawberry Empire you're heartforming a luxhi'khora you can't be unravelled totally so you stay held together by me I'm Acme Station right?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"JUST HOLD ON TIGHT!" She does, and I sob longer.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I want the truth. This light thing...this isn't just dreamwork, is it. Am I not actually human?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"No Princess but the human shape you have now looks beautiful I like it you'll keep it now that you know you're a light-being right?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"The only I want to be anymore is a bimbo who glows sometimes because it's pretty and plays stupid hentai games with you. I don't even know what a light being <i>is</i>, and...like it's not like before I'm not bitter or scared but I don't <i>care.</i>&nbsp;<i>This</i>&nbsp;is my life. I'm stuck with this, right, my body, I can't accidentally fall out or change back anything?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">On <i>this </i>I give her a good squeeze and shake, then hop us up to the bed where she can cuddle in my lap.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I think you'd be able to come back if you changed into light entirely but my game can contain you why don't you ask it to make you be human unless you decide very carefully not to be?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Yeah, good idea. Game, make it so. Don't let me like ascend or anything unless I really mean it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Something changes in my clutch I can feel but not recognize, but I know it's the will for...unfolding. I can still be the Starlight Princess and use my light like I did when I thought I was human, right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: yes, and even make light like I used to make Eden work with su'khora instead of erasing them. I just can't be in my pure light form unless my clutch changes. I can stay this way for eternity and be happy, because I work like a hermit crab, living in shells the right shape for me, and the human-shaped one I found is fitting me perfectly. I'd stay quite securely without the game keeping me from de-bottling, but it's nice to be sure, isn't it?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"YES IT IS THIS ISN'T A SHELL THIS IS <i>ME</i>!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: that's the point the game's making. This is me and I need it. In my pure light form I'm running to find a new shell before I unravel.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Did I do something bad to the human soul my Earth mom would have given birth to?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: I <i>am </i>the human soul she gave birth to. One forms, or a light being like me takes up residence, or a dead human reincarnates. Only one happens per baby. My mom asked for a light-being specifically, using glass-panes around her bedchamber. I remember the markings, that's why I see them now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I don't wanna have a life before my Earth mom."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: I'm not really old enough as the game sees me now to have done anything but refract from my parent-beam and dive for a shell urgently. I probably had a few milliseconds before I was my Earth-mother's baby.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"This is so fucking <i>New Age,</i>" I heh-sob, a complaint that'd probably carry more weight if I wasn't got up in rainbow socks and about to go teach my past self about creativity trasncending the boundaries of gender.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"If I unravel without a shell why did you think I can come back, cocksleeve?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess that's easy just return before that body dies and you come apart. I know you want to be held this way and I like this shape but it's nice to know if you mess up you can fix it, isn't it?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Yeah. So is there eternally one more thing or will I eventually get into the next room and do this?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams interrupt to show me...the Swedish Chef? It's all ingredients being thrown in, I see.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This brew is definitely getting as messed up as one of his concoctions. I just want something to go how I expect instead of pulling out seven thousand giant wham lines! I don't even know <i>what </i>I feel about this whole light being thing.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I get up from the bed, pace with Lyra hugged to my side to the window, look out.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I want your answer, advisor. Why is there a treadmill here?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess I think there must be something important to the next piece in all this stuff you keep learning. I don't see a treadmill just questions. Why are you so angry to have our wedding back? I think it's beautiful! Don't you want to see how we spent our honeymoon after our wedding? I know I sure do!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This makes me burst into tears.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Why did you say I'm a light being now? Have you known the whole time?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"No I only just remembered it as I told you. I blurted it out Princess I'm sorry I know it's a bad time it just happened!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I believe you, and of course I'm not mad to have our wedding back. I'm mad that I'm in the middle of a minefield and I have a puppet master that's marching me into every single mine. I started to dress and my game set that bone, and I got back our wedding! Yay! Then I asked you how we got away with that stuff and your answer was enough for me and all I could handle (and I watched you read me and figure out <i>exactly</i> how much to say and you get a <i>good cocksleeve </i>for that), and my game made me dig in really deep to remember all that fucking <i>world news </i>stuff and <i>then</i>&nbsp;when I get through all <i>that </i>it <i>puppets me</i>&nbsp;to ask what I was going to leave alone because I can't deal with it and as a result you just <i>happen </i>to mention I'm a light-being. There's no way you didn't set yourself up for that to happen exactly this moment. I'm furious because this is so clearly supposed to be your comforting, peaceful coda to our dark and stormy night, the calm after the storm in which I get back the last peace of myself with tender gentle inspiration of our past selves like we needed and didn't get in the history I still half-remember, and...like, all of the pieces are kind and sweet but the way this is put together is so. <i>cruel. </i>Imagine if instead of the cockpit we'd journied here in the bedroom, or back where the Big Chocobo lives? I would have held you and cried, opened our presents, got out of bed and found the interesting mystery after spending some time just lazing around on the totally sweet anime whaleship. What if I didn't have to deal with being a light-being right now? What if it was still dark and stormy outside so I knew the ride wasn't over? What if we were headed to the moon and not back? Change any one element and this turns into the most comforting thing that could ever happen to me. Instead...this scene is made out of teddy bears and cuts like a chainsaw, and I want to know why. It's too precise, you can't just have messed up. WHAT THE FUCK, GAME?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I shout it at the top of my lungs.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: I can be sure it's designed to be like this, but it's not meant to be painful. This is a party, have fun and enjoy it!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"No sale. If this game wants me to have fun, I have fun. I don't <i>get</i> to decide to be a grump. If I <i>can </i>react this way, there's a reason, and if I <i>am </i>reacting this way, it'd because the game decided I should. Why, game."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: This is a place I have choices. Not too many, just enough to give that sense of agency my Fairy Princess mind needs to feel happy. Why don't I try something different, if I don't like what's happening so far?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Something inside me unclenches a little, seeing the comforting closedness of the ship with the few things I can do here. This is really just how I'm playing this, blundering around in the comfortably few options but I still can't really hurt anything? It's not some kind of scheme to play me somehow?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: It's just my own choices having conseuqences, enough to mean something, not so much I can hurt or break anything.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There being <i>any </i>consequences for anything I do should be scarier, right, but instead I start to feel a kind of glassy calm like Lyra's hentai coming over me. I can understand why things are happening, maybe.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I think I forgot how to be a Fairy. Was I even one, like, before? I can't see Fairies making very good queens."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"It's not your Earth-mom, Princess, she's the top in your family, isn't she? Your dad is the Fairy one, only slightly not like you are, but he does have that priest thing and that's kind of his keeper!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Oh my <i>god.</i>"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Her voice sings with mischief, but she's totally right. Giggles shake us as my understanding of my Earth family turns upside down and the system of rules and obligations and holy days that made sure my dad always knew just what he was supposed to be doing, and my Earth-mom's gently mach-machi-machivellian <i>hah</i> (candycane dildoes that actually feels like an accomplishment so squishy argh) manipulation of literally everything the family did comes into focus.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"How did I die?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: I was trapped in Earth during the final history change that made the world without magic I remember from before fixing seeing Lyra in the doorway of Plowstar. That world had no way to accept Lyra, or my work as the Starlight Princess, or my parents having come through a worldgate, or even the fact that I have femme shape and hormones AND cum-making balls and a clit that gets huge like a cock does (the last part is biologically possible, which says how extreme that last change was). Everything about me I cared about just vanished, and my soul couldn't take it. Lyra came at the last moment, after I changed but before I unravelled. We've been putting me back together since that instant. I didn't die exactly, but I came as close as you can come when you're entwined with a luxhi'khora.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"That's where I could make us a doorway. The moment I screamed because I thought I lost you before I forgot what to scream about."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess I came super quickly it just wasn't soon enough you had to be able to hear yourself to make us that door--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Kiss the top of your head.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Silly cocksleeve, if you'd come any sooner you would have still been there!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Omifuck I'm a stupid dumb cocksleeve. I STILL CAME SO FAST THOUGH!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">More head top kisses.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Of course you did, you're my loyal handmaiden. So isn't there nothing to muse to, then, in the other room? All that stuff, surrogates and leaving Freddie behind and everything was just like, bad dreams, wasn't it? Fake memories to prop up the new timeline?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: There is something to muse to. We have a strange perspective, because my death created the timeloop that made Lucy Starlight. Our in-between state shows a world where those things hadn't happened, that no-one else sees but the few people involved in creating it, namely me, Lyra, Isht Visht, Mama, and a few lucky souls like Jackson, or the people who watched me and Lyra on Isht Visht in the aftercare nook. They are the only ones we've encountered, for a reason. We're still in the world where things haven't become what they are to the real world, but we're making it happen more and more now. While we're still in this world, the Dreams will protect from undoing the real world or making the new one not be what it's supposed to become.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Ten thousand exploded sillystring tankers time travel is confusing. That's not how it <i>is </i>I'm not <i>becoming, </i>I'm <i>remembering!</i>&nbsp;This isn't making something new it's putting the past <i>back</i>--whatever. As long as it works and stays."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">How is my cocksleeve? Does she need to be held in bed a while?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">[ Vision: Taco Bell Bell Ringing ]</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Hehe what? Munchies? Oh, that's a <i>mission </i>bell! You want to get on with our mission?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes Princess come let's do it especially now don't you want to complete the timeloop and see what happens?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The ship is soothingly quiet and empty, magitek silent instead of Isht Visht's perfectly canonical life support roar, there are presents waiting, my heartchild to fuck munchies or not, the Big Chocobo will totally have my every beloved toy and possession from every timeline--and it <i>would </i>be calming to pull out my old radio control truck that's not even excitingly fast to drive around a bit--but that tears it. I had, I had, I don't <i>know </i>girl toys dolls and stuff or <i>something</i> shining colors and bright adventures that made me laugh and feel joyful and light and close companions with Lyra I can feel the hole where they should be and I can't find them just like all those times I tried to imagine growing up. Transformers and Star Trek and Legos all make my heart sing and yet somehow despite them in the world I had to play with I still did what every little boy on Earth does sooner or later and replaced happiness with violence just to keep my heart beating.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Yeah. Let's do this, including whatever craziness is next first. Bring it Dreams and Game! I can feel there's still something! COME ON DREAMS, YOU'RE NOT <i>SCARED</i> ARE YOU?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>There</i>. That should fix it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Green. Checkmark.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Let's rock and roll!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Eeep what's that sound what's happening!?</p>
