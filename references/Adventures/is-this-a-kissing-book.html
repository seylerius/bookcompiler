    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">68 - Is This a Kissing Book</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd"></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Mama stops eating to Not Cry for a moment. Is it my place to...fuck it, Mama needs a hug. I turn and wrap her up, and she happily rests in my cleavage.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Love you, Mama."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I love you too Pussytaste! I want some waffles, let me up but keep a hand on me if you can spare one from Lyra--and you know I mean that very straight and directly now!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Cocksleeve, grab me with your tail."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Grab Mommy top of arm tail!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Before I even have time to let go of Mama and get back to my own food, her tail is coilling happily around my upper arm. I turn back, put one hand back on Mama's thigh, the other on Lyra's knee, and grin at her: waffles, cocksleeve! --actually toast and drinks first, you know what you're doing.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes Mommy I watch and I see!</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Now that we've finished with that, what else can the prophecy say to us? I was quite horny to try going through it! I think we should look at the part that describes our new life together. It looks like a straightforward paragraph, but I smell a puzzle inside it! Turn the side, Klapta!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The monolith spins to show the next panel.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW"><i>Far from every hostel Lucy Blu'eyes rests in the Star with her companion. Nothing lonely troubles her, because her friends lie close, bedded down to sleep with her. Soon they will wake, and Lucy will sneak away with squishy anime devil to spend free time together. Her friends will stay in bed a while but soon they'll have breakfast made and the scent of sex and coffee will call Lucy and her cocksleeve-friend out to be companions. Far off, shining lights ping a sensor-sweep and open eyes on their latest scan, to see what this new fun thing can be, and the trans-warp drives and booster-packs open ways to their adventure for the day--or week or millenium. They never really tell until they get into the situation. One time, they even get twenty miles into the bottom of a command unit for the ice of twisting venus and make camp inside its stormglobe, using their body heat to warm each other as they march naked through the snowstorm (boots are all they bring with them).</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Wait hold up, you're right Mama! That's not my name anymore! If this is talking about a literal moment and not just explaining how much our life as a family is going to <i>fucking rule, </i>the time in which...cocksleeve, is there <i>any</i>&nbsp;time this could have happened in? We all hung out in bed on Isht Visht--Mama, did you fix up my whole jacket between capturing my Arwing and my getting down there and wrap it and everything? Um--oh no Mama did I fry my nose stud <i>and </i>my jacket!? You must have worked so hard on those!"<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Boobsqueeze what are you talking about? I thought your game must have given you that jacket, since you were wearing it without my permission. The nose-stud was pretty too, but I didn't give you it that I know of--I'll bet you got a present from my future self again! It was in the Arwing, wasn't it. The jacket is beautiful! Isht Visht put it into her safe place while we were falling, and it will be safe and sound there as long as it needs to. I don't see your nose-stud anymore, and I didn't take it, but maybe your game did? Mine can put things away when it wants to..."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Her voice makes me think she's had some adventures with that during her last alone time with Isht Visht. Game?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">My hands squeeze Lyra and Mama as my nose-hole fills suddenly with the cool metal shaft of my diamond. I flash to third person, see it shining there (seriously, shining, game did you polish it!?), flash back into my head before the added kinkiness of ogling <i>myself </i>along with the rest of the family sends me onto the table to fuck Lyra right there and send our snack everywhere, breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: the game did the same with my clit to keep it from melting my purse things. My purse is okay because it's made out of Lyra and can withstand any temperature.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Hooray for being too much of a ditz to have thought to worry about that this whole time. I throb it with kegels just to feel it, and the soft silky walls of the game's containment gently embrace it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I can really just be completely stupid, can't I. You keep telling me that game but I keep not getting it. That's what having a safe container is.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: stupid isn't precisely the word for it. Irresponsible has connotations the game doesn't mean, but there is no need or ability for me to take responsibility for anything but Lyra. The game put my nose-stud in storage when I got too hot to wear it without melting the silver because it took responsibility for keeping my jewelry from being vaporized. This wasn't a mistake or oversight for me not to think of putting it away when I shine. I'm supposed leave it to the game to take care of things for me. I've been leaving toys around since the black mirror in the aftercare nook, and the game has been cleaning up after me. Every single toy I've played with is put away safely where it should be and waiting for me when I want it next. Even the coffee mug Lyra replicated me is in the game's storage, with the coffee still in it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">That's so...<i>easy.</i>&nbsp;It's going to change who I am, all this stuff. I wonder who I'll be--oh. <i>Whoah.</i>&nbsp;My crown sparkles on the table next to my plate.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Every little girl wants to be a princess, the game told me. Don't princesses have armies of invisible-to-them servants who follow them around just taking care of stuff for them like I do with the game now? They get pretty crowns and all the toys they want and don't have to worry about anything at all...because the idea is to focus all their energy on looking good for the family, and landing a good marriage alliance, and preparing to one day run a country where succession by murder totally works if you can just get away with the murder.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">But that part is boring, and you don't get to have your Mama read you stories anymore, and how are you supposed to have fun with all the <i>attention </i>of being princess if you're trying to get one single husband? I don't even like boys!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">So Lyra found a way to get rid of all the boring parts and let me be a princess the way little girls imagine--well, okay, probably more like they way horny porn writers imagine it--while I still live with my Mama and have midnight breakfast with her and storytime by the fire <i>while I play with my dolly, </i>bwaha. I won't be the subject of excited gossip in any town I'm coming to except maybe this house, but so what? All the adoration and worship (and then some, because why ever stop at <i>enough</i>) I'll ever need is kneeling in front of me feeding me waffles right now. She might have found ways to make this game help me kill an evil god and jailbreak a prison universe, but just as evil as Eden's cruel webs would be anything it might do to forcibly arrange me millions of--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">With the slightest of tugs the game moves my eyes to the Strawberry Queen on the cover of the book it gave me. Her face makeup is the same as mine, as is the shape of her face, and tall, voluptuous frame. The only thing that's different is the Strawberry Queen's eyes are older than mine.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">People who have this book on their shelf will recognize me instantly.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">My eyes turn next to Mama sitting and eating her waffles, and I think about why she would have a heart attack meeting my Earth mother and learning that the she's part of the Strawberry Dynasty. Wouldn't that be just like learning your family has noble blood from a few hundred years ago? Hell, my Earth family <i>did that</i>&nbsp;with geneology and found out we had a coat of arms and everything. It's fun, but doesn't give heart attacks to strangers who've just introduced your oldest child to erotic spanking.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Just who the hell does she think I am?</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Are you--hey sis how is Lucy doing right now?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy what can I tel her--no you're busy be helpful.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Sis can you tell me how many people have books like that? Is the Strawberry Dynasty famous?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Lyra's sweet voice cuts through my ditz-out but I miss her words, and Mama drops her fork suddenly. When I look, she's sitting hunched over her plate with her elbows on the table and her face in her hands, and peeks out of her fingers at me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Are there many people interested in the Strawberry Dynasty!? Oh Pussywillow I forget you're from Earth sometimes! I'm too embarrassed! Klapta, you tell them."</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Captain I didn't think of it either, it's just kind of like--alright actually that's the perfect metaphor. Like I'm totally going through it right now looking for a comparison! The cultural landscape in the nineteen ninties on Earth had so few big properties its hard to contextualize because I want to...imagine you guys if Earth suddenly got really into computers because they totally changed the economy and suddenly you had to be able to program to have enough money to like even have a home, and everything computer nerds like became so massively profitable they could make new entire franchies to have games and movies and shows and expanded universes like take everything Disney has and now suddenly everyone has that kind of interest, so like I don't want you to think it's the <i>only</i>&nbsp;big mythology in fantasy because it's still part of a landscape that's a lot bigger than you're used to on Earth, but like, if everybody knew what Zelda and Final Fantasy are the way they know about Star Wars and Trek (which happens actually it's totally sweet) and the cultural landscape was bigger for all the other game series you know about but your parents never heard of to be that famous without anything else getting knocked off the pedastal, the Strawberry Dynasty would be one of them--oh wait! You guys know porn isn't second class art outside of places like Earth--wait of course you can't! Like everywhere else it's another genre like action or thrillers, not some kind of thing you should be ashamed of, so like, I don't mean big in the porn world like Earth has, just big in the sense of maybe a series like Xena was in your time if Xena had movies and games and toy tie-ins...do you guys get what I'm talking about? It's really hard to explain this accurately! Earth culturally just isn't like this in the nineties! Okay what if you think of it this way. The Strawberry Queen is one of those characters like Captain Marvel or Iron Man, like everybody knows who they are, right, even if it's not Batman or Superman, they can reasonably be part of the Avengers with the Incredible Hulk without everyone being all 'why the hell are they doing a team up with B-list characters' just like it isn't like you're Beowulk of Achilles <i>maybe </i>I guess it is kind of close technically because of how the Strawberry Queen is ancient mythology but she gets new stories constantly it's not like there's a historical canon that can't be added to that's why I didn't go for a historical figure at first. Captain had a whole library of books like this when she was in playworld! You want me to get you some? Captain can I show them your favorite print ediition of--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Boobsqueeze I don't want you to feel like it's any kind of obligation, especially after what you just said about your losing freedom because of family obligations, but what my Klapta is trying to gently introduce you to is that the Strawberry Dynasty is very famous, but that whatever history the family had is invisible behind all the fun stories people say could be history and it just isn't possible to find out because they existed so long ago. Yes I was very interested in them, but I thought they were just a fantasy until your crown floated up to me! I was very curious about that LaVerdier's bag, because I hadn't seen plastic before, and your crown was very beautiful, but I thought I was just kindly sent something to play with next time I had fun with a big bouncy human, not being given the actual Strawberry Dynasty's headpiece! That is the real one. I've checked and checked, and I was able to use it to pull up enough about the original Strawberry Dynasty to find out who your Earth mother actually was. The Dreams didn't let me say I was giving the crown to you, because she doesn't want to remember--she told me that when I met her, and the Dreams warned me not to explain more than what the game said with my voice to make me find out who she was in her past life. Klapta, I think you were afraid of doing what already happened before I even was born in my playworld so many thousands of years ago! The Strawberry Dynasty's known for it's sexy adventures, that's everything! You were worried that crown would mean you had to be someone your Earth mother could be proud of as the heir to her dynasty, you said that about losing your freedom because of that is how I see it, but Boobsqueeze the family duty I think you must be carrying is your Earth mother feeling afraid of <i>her</i> past retaking <i>her</i>!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">My heart is racing and it feels like I can't breathe, and my vision seems dim, and then the dam breaks and I snatch up my crown and hold it against myself, whispering out the sobbing realization:</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"It was never me. It wasn't my fault I didn't <i>do</i>&nbsp;it whatever it was it wasn't <i>me!"</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Klapta, what are you talking about? Boobsqueeze come here let your Mama hold you."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Mama puts her arms around me and turns me to her. I relax into her soothing peppery-scented hug, and take a deep breath. My voice still whispers.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I always my whole life growing up felt like I wrecked something for my parents, like their life wasn't what it was supposed to be because I existed. Even when I was a kid I couldn't understand why though...my mom acted like raising her kids was literally the entire point of her existence and my dad wasn't different and they seemed <i>happy</i>&nbsp;to have kids and yet...like it was just always <i>there</i>&nbsp;and when I got older I started being convinced it was there sex life like they'd been living like us or something and you--they can't if they have kids so it had to stop and they were sad which is a fucked up thing for a kid to think about their parents but that's not even the really fucked up thing...it wasn't <i>me</i>, though, it never was! Yeah, something got wrecked, it was whatever happened to make her not want to remember being the Strawberry Queen! My Earth mom is <i>so afraid</i>, all the time, she acts like...honestly like there's assassins around every corner and poison in every meal and a bomb in every car and oh god my poor other mom Mama did she seem better? Was she not so scared anymore? You said the whole country ended when she died, was there like a civil war or something--no. Don't answer that. If she doesn't want to remember neither do I. I know what Strawberry Princess I'm going to be and I don't need to dig that stuff up to do it. I just need you to read me a lot of stories, Mama. Will you read to me and Lyra from your books too?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">She's hugging me tight, and Lyra's tail is tight on my arm, but I need to look at her to do this and I can't believe I'm able to play my own hope and determination and grief this way except none of it is lying or even doing anything but telling the truth hard enough in our weird form of relationship.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Is fifteen too old for you to tuck me in and read to me and Lyra?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">My heart rushes and I feel <i>air currents </i>silky on my 'pussy' as I say it. What the fuck why is that so <i>hot</i>&nbsp;what the hell is <i>with </i>me--</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Pussywillow I thought you'd never ask! Yes of course I'll read to you from my story books about all kinds of fun people! The Strawberry Dynasty is my favorite, but I have a <i>big</i>&nbsp;library, with all kinds of fun things!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Holy fuck she's so horny from this I can <i>smell her</i>. HOT.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"That would be so awesome, Mama."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">It's...so <i>human</i>&nbsp;I want some I--I squeeze Mama and sit up, knowing what I'll do if I keep hugging, wanting it to happen, still so full of things to say and talk about...and I want to see my crown, too. And Lyra and...my head is spinning, dizzy with excitement and confusion.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Mama puts her hand on my thigh, so I spread for her a little. Will she take me? Do I want her to? I'm wet, but...she reaches further in, but that's all. I take my crown away from my boobs and look at it, staring at the stawberry catching the light.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I see your crown is a happy thing for you now. Will you wear it for me?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">This makes me smile.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Mama you're never going to get this off my head once I put it on. I--I don't think I can wait for my birthday but I wanna have a coronation! What'd the Strawberry Dynasty do, I bet your books say, right? If we got married naked I bet coronations were just as good!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Well boobsqueeze, you can have a coronation tonight just with our family if you feel as impatient as I'm feeling, if you listen while I read you the story of the Princess' Seedling. Klapta, book!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy Princess Seedling if you're being the Strawberry Princess that means I'm who that story's about right you'll make me help with your coronation? Please Mommy I want to be useful--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I halt her thoughts with a giggly-grinning <i>zzp </i>in my mind. Yes of course you're helping you silly cocksleeve, didn't you see me having fantasies of you worshipfully setting my crown on my head? That's half the reason I asked for a coronation!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">EEEE okay Mommy I'm ready I think Rada should be able to do something too though it is her fantasy we're doing!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">...and that was the other half. Or maybe she'd be my knight in shining armor. Can you imagine Mama in full plate?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Actually I kind of can that's a very interesting feeling if I imagine myself naked in the picture gah.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy isn't it fun, though? Doesn't it make you all wet to imagine yourself being vulnerable with her being strong like that?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Yes. Eep. Anyway, cocksleeve, I think this is kind of all of our fantasy, and I want to find out how the pieces go together with all of us. You can't tell me you don't want to be cocksleeve to the horniest princess in the land--can you?</p>

<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Isht Visht reaches into her hyperspace cupboard again and pulls out an ancient-looking brown leatherbound book with an oval painting of the Strawberry Queen looking over her shoulder seductively in the middle of the cover. Mama takes the book and opens it, pages the worn-in pages to a spot she's obviously opened hundred of times.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Now I'm just going to read a little bit like the last time, because I'm still very curious about this prophecy, but we have to have something to look forward to, and you should be able to start planning how you'll make your coronation and think about whether you want to do it this way."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Isht Visht's definition of <i>Waifu</i>&nbsp;echoes in my head as she starts reading. <i>Wait, fuck, that means--</i></p>

<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">And if you felt beautiful when I named you that you were paying attention, <i>Lyra.</i></p>

<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Actually it's weird twice, like, I didn't really know how she worked then, I just thought she was more beautiful than starlight and of course she's sparkly and I thought about constellations and my mind went right for <i>Lyra</i>&nbsp;which of course is the harp but ever since thing I keep learning how I can <i>play </i>her like a harp like I don't even know how to describe it she's...it's this incredibly subtle mind control that somehow never makes her any less of her own person, if anything the more I learn to play the more of her I know, and like, <i>Lyra </i>is such the perfect name but because <i>harp</i>&nbsp;not <i>stars--</i>"</p>

I really like all of them and I don't think I'm just a really young seedling who isn't heartformed into one archetype it just feels like I'm all of them."</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Sis, relax, I think you're just genderfluid. Just because I'm a ship super binary doesn't mean you have to pick an archetype! Maybe you're even missing some, like, how did it feel being a Super Nintendo while Lucy was flying the <i>Waifu</i> away from Captain? Did you get euphoria from being a videogame, kind of? Maybe you guys should try stuff that leans into that! You are SNES colors after all. Can't just be a coincidence. Try it sometime, I can help you! I know all kinds of fun ideas for Object-play!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Sis that would be wonderful Mommy can we Rada please may Isht Visht help us?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Joy surges as I look her silvery shape up and down, just from seeing her, and I start to see just how clever her game is, how everything its been doing does go back to bringing me closer to her directly. I believe she would do all of <i>this</i> in a heartbeat just because she loves me, but...every step up this stair puts another piece of my heart back online and lets me <i>feel </i>and I'd be afraid what I feel for her would tear me apart were it not for the (literally) universe-breaking rage I've already burned with.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">--and there really is room in there for more than one love because somehow in this fury of happy need I can still feel my want for Mama to keep reading and her hand on my thigh and her kindness in the breakfast she made us, undimmed by the supernova in front of me.</p>

I already believed you, but--wait. Maybe this story is originally English, but there's no way my Earth mom spoke it when she was the Strawberry Queen! What's the likelihood the rhyme worked in her language? How?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Boobsqueeze they translated the saying rhyming because it was fun that way, but there are dozens of versions for all different languages! Listen, here's one in Infernal using a rhyming way that works on the ends of the lines like in English: <i>ahb aktija nhobjach, va klaptija mozzach. </i>If you want to be truly excited, fuck your aunt very heartily! That's what's in my book I'm translating from Infernal as I read to you, but I've heard the English version over and over. It's not so surprising! Incest is a very common desire, isn't it, boobsqueeze?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">She puts her hand close up to my pussy lip and shifts closer to me on the bench. My feelings whirl. Don't you have to be related first? Mama and I <i>are though</i>, my heart replies without hesitation, so I follow with <i>yes but I never felt this way about my Earth mother AAH OH GOD DID I!?!?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Then I realize: she was thirty years younger in the window the game gave me to look at my family. She was beautiful, I thought, in the way a little kid thinks its mother is beautiful, but no tiny speck of attraction sparked when I saw her--I would know now, Mama makes it easy to compare!</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I'm going to keep reading now, we're almost to the part I wanted to read you. Do you feel okay about everything with your Earth mother? We can talk if you want to, but your silence and face say you're peaceful now."</p>

<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">My little construct is racing. Poor cocksleeve. I stroke her breast soothingly as Mama contiues:</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"--the floor by her princess' feet. Majesty of course was a bit premature just yet, but Lucy thought it might do to get used to it before coronation. She would already have so much to think about! Best not to make it harder than necessary to get used to her title while she was trying to get used to taking the throne and responsibility that came with it! She might have just wished to be princess eternally like her sister would, but being the Queen came with...privileges. No more sneaking across the balcony, for one! That of course was just the beginning..."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Melody watched at her feet, waiting for something to jump on and get them into a playtime, but nothing occurred to Lucy that Melody could get a finger inside. Majesty really was stuck on this! There must be something to do for her. Majesty liked to be naughty and wicked, and Melody had all sorts of powers nobody but the two of them knew about, like making Lucy look like a handmaid and turning into a book Lucy seemed to be reading with some kind of sexy fun&nbsp;title, or flying across gaps like the space between balconies with wings as silent as owls have, or being able to tell when no one was looking so reliably the two of them could play Lucy to orgasm right in the middle of the stage for the rehearsal of next full moon's festivities, or just being so obsequeously compliant Lucy thought she would cum from pure service."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"This evening, however, none of them seemed applicable. If only Majesty could have some way of pretending it was time already! They were practicing the ritual every day and then sexily every evening alone in her chamber, and they had just finished doing that, so she couldn't just suggest that they role play--could she? What if they made a new game up, one fit for a Strawberry Queen? The Strawberry Dynasty's beauty must be honored every moment it can be! Maybe the ritual everyone had been planning wasn't good enough! Could Lucy and Melody find some way to make it appropriate to a true Strawberry Queen? Far from being too far in the future to think about without whimpering, the coronation might come before they had finished fixing the ritual! Lucy exclaimed with delight as Melody explained the idea to her, and they started immediately."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"The first thing to do, Melody told her carefully to make sure she could see how much she respected her Princess' horniness, was get Lucy to think up something sexual to go with each part of the ritual. Could they make the entire ritual into something as horny as Lucy was? Melody felt sure they could! Yes they had been practicing it naked how Strawberry Queens are supposed to reign, but surely there was more than <i>that</i> they could do."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Lucy thought through the ritual as they had practiced it. She would enter the throne room from the doors at front with her handmaidens--Melody hidden among them--and walk the length of the court chamber to meet with the Crownbearer and bannermen who would bow and then follow her into the center of the stage to wait for the high preistess to arrive with <i>her </i>entourage, and bless both the Princess and crown before following her up to the dais where the throne was. How they made that part take most of an hour was still amazing to both of them, but if you spend enough time bowing and talking, you can take all day doing anything. Lucy would sit on the throne in nothing but her finest of bracelets and face-paint, feel what it felt like to be naked without getting in trouble right there in the middle of everything, and wait while the high priestess blessed her <i>again</i>. There would be some more bowing and talking and reading from edicts and law books, the high preistess would make the declaration that fate and the gods and the stars had predestined this, and call the crownbearer up with the diadem. She would stop right beside Lucy with the crown held on her arms like a baby, and the high priestess would lay it on Lucy's head. There would be lots more bowing and talking, and the bannermean would each kneel and kiss her foot to pledge her they fealty (t<i>hat</i>&nbsp;was a fun part to imagine). Then there would be a reception, but they already had <i>plans </i>to make that fun."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"There. Now you can imagine what kind of fun ceremony we might do with the four of us!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Oh my god. Cocksleeve I think we both have new role models."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Mommy yes I would like that please! Melody seems super awesome already!"</p>

<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"If only there was a magical substance that'd make your body ready to fuck and stay up forever with just a few drops!" I grin ironically, reach past the plate, and dip a taste out of Lyra's desperately puffy and wet <i>sex, </i>and lick it off of my fingertips hungrily. Like a drug, it comforts me, candy-sex relief of a need I've been building up for a while now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Haah! Mommy pussy-touch...very horny now...</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Now let's get that prophecy! Boobsqueeze, what were you asking Lyra? You asked if could have literally done what the paragraph described, yeah? Lyra, is your memory just like my Klapta's, where you remember things perfectly if you've seen them instantly?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes Rada when I see something I always remeber exactly what was happening and what it looked like like a picture from a camera. Mommy asked if the thing the prophecy talks about is possible and I say no because Mommy wasn't Lucy yet when she went to sleep in Ten Forward even though everyone was around her, and she hasn't had coffee since the cup I made her then, and now if we sleep altogeth like I hope we will it still won't be possible because now the other name isn't her anymore so I time never came when what this says could literally be true."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I scan the prophecy again:</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW"><i>Far from every hostel Lucy Blu'eyes rests in the Star with her companion. Nothing lonely troubles her, because her friends lie close, bedded down to sleep with her. Soon they will wake, and Lucy will sneak away with squishy anime devil to spend free time together. Her friends will stay in bed a while but soon they'll have breakfast made and the scent of sex and coffee will call Lucy and her cocksleeve-friend out to be companions. Far off, shining lights ping a sensor-sweep and open eyes on their latest scan, to see what this new fun thing can be, and the trans-warp drives and booster-packs open ways to their adventure for the day--or week or millenium. They never really tell until they get into the situation. One time, they even get twenty miles into the bottom of a command unit for the ice of twisting venus and make camp inside its stormglobe, using their body heat to warm each other as they march naked through the snowstorm (boots are all they bring with them).</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I agree, but I wonder if it might be talking anyway about the time I almost gave her a siezure with cotton blankets aboard Klapta here--Star on Sea, that's how you say the name Isht Visht in English. It's the only time Lucy with two names bedded down with us! We were far from anything, too--this house is a very long way from where we landed then! I think these word choices are very strange, though English isn't my or my Klapta's firt language. How do you see them, Boobsqueeze and Lyra? Hostel makes sense, but wouldn't someone from your time in America say <i>house</i>&nbsp;or <i>inn </i>to sound fancy?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Mommy why does it have your name but not my name? Those have to be me you said I'm an anime devil right when you say me but it spells out your name even the apostrophe so where is mine?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Good point, cocksleeve! And I'm pretty sure I remember <i>three </i>companions when we all bedded down together. It could be when you and me were having alone time--no, Mama or maybe Isht Visht didn't you say you went Galaxy class and then didn't have the heart to fill with partiers? Like a hostel, maybe? <i>Nothing lonely </i>is weird too, you're right Mama--I know what's wrong with this! Game, I want my happy meal."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">This is a double guess, but if I'm right, what else will the toy be? If I'm wrong the result will be awesomely humiliating and <i>maybe I could go for that </i>AAH.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">A door opens in space in front of me, the Happy Meal falls out cartoonishly, and lands on the table perfectly flat between Lyra's knee my plate. It's themed to be part of the game, with pictures that could never be found on an actual happy meal of the family enjoying fun times and exploring strange caverns made of statues like the ones we saw in Ten Forward. There are pop-out things and connect the dots and everything real happy meals have, but this is not for kids who aren't like I am! I blush with embarrassment, then turn to see Mama looking just interested.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"What do you see, Boobsqueeze? Did the game change your Earth-food for you?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I think I just didn't know I'm an age-player yet. If I'm right you're about to know what I see."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Can I open this? A Happy Meal has <i>got </i>to count as a toy--<i>Sssssslip--</i>nope! The dizzy nothing of slipping really does feel good, and I catch myself doing it for a long time...I probably could pick it up if I wanted to play with the box things, huh. Anyway:</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Cocksleeve, get me the toy--and a small fry damn that smells good."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Put down fork open happy meal look inside for thing. Toy there you are what's <b>inside</b> of this it's heavy like--Mommy it's--yes calm cocksleeve put toy on table take out fries and put them beside your plate. Close up happy meal. Calm cocksleeve Mommy heavy on strings feels good or will when I feel again...</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">She's like an instrument because I can <i>play her for drama. </i>Put the Happy Meal aside, cocksleeve, and open the toy up for us.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Happy meal place beside me out of reach for knocking. Take toy, hold it up to see. Shing my fingernail, slice it open--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I stop "muting" her at just the right moment:</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><b>MOMMY IT'S A MONOLITH!!!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Ladies and cocksleeves, Monolith 66."</p>
