    <p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Hold it up show the family</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Boobsqueeze how did you know that was in there!?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"NO WAY LET ME SEE I'LL ENLARGE IT FOR US!!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Show her, cocksleeve."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Here sis, see all four sides top and bottom too.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Isht Visht for whatever reason the thing you said about how each Monolith going back was like worse translation than the one before it, and I was looking at the prophecy just now being like...it's not that this is even wrong, it like, feels like the text in Final Fantasy or something, and I realized we're stuck because this panel's too glitched out to read. Coming right after that thing with me saying--saying words that're too big for me being the clue I realized if we time-travelled to make all this it'd be exactly set up for the next thing we would do to need that clue, which it did, our being stuck meant it was time for the next monolith, but like, we already have <i>so much </i>ahead of us just tonight in our house, and I don't <i>wanna </i>go out again this is cozy, so the next monolith must be here somehow, and I've been curious whether I was right about my McDonald's bag turning into a Happy Meal because honestly now that I think about I was really sad to outgrow them like I kept eating them until it wasn't enough food anymore, and I dunno it was just a leap like haha what if the toy was a tiny monolith it's always some little statue like that<i>&nbsp;and Happy Meals always have a thing where you're trying to collect all the different toys </i>sure self now you think of that."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">How'd I miss such an obvious clue? Maybe not enjoying myself enough is making me dumb or something. I give my breasts a good squeeze and press and it makes me feel hornier, but my sight seems almost sharper and more detailed at the same time. What's this new fun, game?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: my mind needs the chemicals having fun like that releases to function right. Sexual pleasure of any kind can give me them, but if I don't keep enough in my bloodstream, I'll get fuzzy like that. The game from the Arwing was like training wheels to help me realize what my needs are.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Why does that feel so incredibly happy to learn?</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"This is very different now! Isht Visht, are you recording this for the prophecy club? Send it out immediately!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Already am, Captain! You guys this is going to destroy their whole theory look there's not even a warning to Eden now it's an entirely new panel and the side that said that stuff about transformation changed hehe check it out there are Strawberries everywhere!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Nooo don't foreshadow me I want to surprise everyone!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Spikes up a cuntbag sorry Lucy I didn't think of that! I can erase the message but people are already seeing it--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Klapta don't you worry. People might see Strawberry Dynasty in those strawberries, but that club will make it so confusing everything you'll get out of that is everyone wondering what will happen. This is our game, it'll play right into your wishes for your comeback if you're going to make one, I'm sure of it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Isht Visht replaces Monolith 65 with the new one.</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"So what panel do we start on? The club numbers 'em this way, but I think they're wrong you guys."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Boobsqueeze, does that--Happy Meal have clues on it? I saw all sorts of fun child things, maybe one of them helps us know where to start with this."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Pluck.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Find Happy Meal, hold it up to show everyone. Oooh pretty hentai!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">My thoughts become what the game picks for me out of nowhere, and it feels like my fingers want to pop out every punch-out I can find. I reach for the Happy Meal without taking it off Lyra's hands where she's holding it, and punch out the section that makes a decoder ring from the side facing me. My hands fit the pieces of cardboard together a swiftly as if they were legos, and I turn to face Mama with it in my hands. Holding it out like a piece of surveying equipment, I sight along the edge like a telescope to look at the expanded vision Isht Visht is displaying, and adjust it until it lines up paper rings with a strawberry carved near the first line of text and the one at the end of the text. I look at the side of the instrument, read the number, make sure Lyra notices, swipe to the next and read all four sides with the same technique.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Still in the game's sexy controlling embrace, I turn to the side of the monolith the instrument told me was the first one, set the tool down, and start reading--it's the side we began on before!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>"Far from every hot steel Lucy lightly rests in the Star with her companions. Loafing while they snuggle her, she hugs her family close, wedded now to sleep with her.

<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">My mind seems to be under my own control again. I think you can set that down again, cocksleeve, and get me toast--the really buttery one.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Happy Meal back to table hehe drippy toast is like me now!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Okay, that's a lot more clear, but what are the Seven Sexy Coffins?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"That's the story next after the one I was reading just now in my book! Let's read it too! Boobsqueeze that one will excite you, and maybe you Lyra. I know it does Klapta and I! I bet it has clues in it if we listen carefully, but let's see what the rest says. Far from every hot steel confuses me. What do you see, family? Is there something in that to your eyes?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I see something! After we came out of Limbo the car we made into the deliverator-mobile came to see us to say it was okay I guess. We stole that car, technically, and stolen things can be hot in detective stuff, and cars are steel, so maybe that means far from where we came out of Limbo which we were then it's like a thousand light years, right? I say that because next it says Lucy rests light in the Star capital S and we all know who that is! Now I say that did happen it's in the bed in sis after the soliton wave ride."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Yeah, and the rest up to Seven Sexy Coffins just looks like our trip getting here, unless that like conflicts somehow with your alone time, Mama and Isht Visht? 'Free time' is an interesting way to put our ride isn't it cocksleeve, but it totally works, I learned some stuff about freedom.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Mommy yes that was definitely learning freedom."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Our time happened entirely in bed, so I agree. It seems like the Seven Sexy Coffins is very important next. I don't think we know how it calls anyone out to be companions until we read it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"I see Star Trek! Sensor-@weep fan of the skies in their greatest scan! Sweet, does that mean we get picked up by a bigtime Trekker?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Come over here and you'll be picked up by <i>two</i> bigtime Trekkers--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Hey that does mean outside the family, right? Do we think that?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Boobsqueeze is there any other kind of sensor-sweep fan than Star Trek? I think it could mean something else because the phrase is longer than we need to see Star Trek. Does that make anyone see anything?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Haah that isn't Star Trek after all! That's searching for aliens! Who would be searching for aliens in Rl'yeh Sade, though, aren't aliens everywhere here? I'm not human and not from Earth and my ears are pointed like Vulcans and I have grey skin just ilke Andorians!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"I thought there would be something else in that! I wonder who could be looking for aliens, unless they aren't in the Four Dreams who see us? Maybe there are people out there who want to see outside their own world, and we can shine lights they can see? That would be interesting, wouldn't it?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Captain we talked about this. No more saving the worlds, remember?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"My game is letting me mention it, so maybe it isn't like what I was doing with TRAIN and virgin-hunting. What if it's just that our light shines out into other worlds somehow. That seems fun to think about, but why would our prophecy tell us? Do these next verses help any?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Lucy StarFox just calls it boosters in the manuals. Have you heard anybody on Earth say booster-<i>packs</i>?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"No that I've heard. I call it acceleration or booster to myself. You don't think it could mean booster packs like cards like Magic The Gathering, do you?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Oh, yeah, that makes sense!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Those have cards in them that make the game bigger, so maybe other worlds might call to us, not for saving them, but to add to our adventures? I'm always going to like travelling, my heartchild's a ship after all!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Transwarp works with that in Star Trek but I can't help thinking it's actually something about Lucy being trans because yeah, tajk about not ending up where she started!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"That's what's so ironic, like, I don't think I can describe how <i>home </i>this place is to me, and yet...cocksleeve can you imagine telling my Earth dad about me being Lucy the Horny Strawberry Princess and living in Rl'yeh Sade with--with <i>this</i>&nbsp;family?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"They would be so weirded out by everything! Even just your name being Lucy now!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Lucy wait a minute. How long have you been into Star Trek? Like is it watching tapes or did you see TNG first air? Deep Space 9, same question. You've never heard of Voyager, right?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">More weepiness or maybe just the same naked tenderness continuing as I taste this new nostalgia and realize we've already happily done it once:</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I watched it from the beginning with my family all snuggled on the couch together, every week, all the way through. Fuck, if I'm fifteen that's more than half my life! The only time I missed episodes was when we went on vacation to--here, actually--and then we would haunt reruns until we caught up. Deep Space Nine, same thing, though we only got two-I-think seasons in before Lyra and I left for here. What's Voyager?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Best Trek out there?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"TNG is the Trekkest Trek <i>and </i>it has Picard."</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Alright then I think the prophecy's next part is about what we do after storytime. Sorry, Captain."</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"What are you thinking, Klapta? I know we'll get out eventually, I'm just very horny for adventure and excitement that takes me someplace I havn't been yet!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"There's no Trekker Trek than TBG, so that's the skies in their greats scan after all because I doubt Lucy was thinking that when she answered me just now. Lights ping a sensor-sweep fan of the skies, that's Lt. Commander Data you guys. Far off, because yeah, the Star Trek universe is hella far from here. We can still watch on TV though! That makes sense after storytime if you guys have as much hyper energy as it seems like--and Lucy girlfriend or whatever our relationship is let's talk about that after this yeah Lucy two words, girl. Slumber. Party. Forcefem doctor prescribes. No outsies. Bet your game even makes you! Sis you're coming too obviously but I mean DUH. I was like okay then what's this new fun thing like it's <i>everything</i>! I have so much stuff to introduce you guys to! The nineties are the birth of Earthling geek culture for the next forty years <i>easily</i>! You guys know there's so many Zelda games you have to be clear which <i>edition </i>you're talking about? Oh bet yoiu haven't played StarFox <i>64</i>, Lucy! Wanna get Marathon with scripting and 3D acceleration? Totally can, on every platform, including UNIX that was just getting started except you're nerd enough I bet you heard of it already called Linux! It unseated windows entirely before the end, killed it dead completely, Microsoft ended the product line! Those are examples you guys, there's SO MUCH and you should <i>see </i>how porn developed on Earth! It's no Strawberry Dynasty but I was proud anyway! The Internet made it so small-time exhibitionists could start pushing the abusive industrial studios off their pedastal and you should see the GAMES that got made! We will later if we're still on going through H-Games for your eravahk design oh wait forcefem doctor's orders you have to be right Lucy's game?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">My game shows a purple circle of acceptance to each of Isht Visht's proposals, but I just sit open-mouth. There are too many incredible things is what she just said to respond to.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"How are the games doing illusions like that? Can we see them physically, or do they just put the sight of them into our eyes?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: the purple yes-rings actually made physical light shine in the room where we're sitting. It would be visible far away if someone looked in the window.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"My game just--I see yours did also. I'm a sensor-sweep fan, I just said so! You always scan new places to see if there's something interesting, that's just obvious! Those lights have pinged me now. They make me think of something I taught in playworld when I was first starting in that. My very first thing to help people grow to understand, was aetherwork! That's how I made the wind blow for Isht Visht to take us home after we finished with Earth, and then I made the hair dryer out of my fingers to make your hair fluffy again after the rain made it flat. Illusions everyone can see is another thing to use aetherwork for. The game called Magic the Gathering has many things you can make happen because you're a wizard, and booster-packs make the game bigger by giving you more of them. I can give you all kinds of booster packs that way, boobsqueeze! Would you like to be able to make fireworks, or have a halo of strawberries? Let me teach you klapta it'll be wonderful! Let's start, boobsqueeze, the first thing I can teach you will take five seconds! Hold your hands just like I am now."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Mama puts her silverware down again and holds her hands out like she's about to shoot Force lightning. I mimic her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Should Lyra move?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Lyra can stay where she is now. Do you see how it feels like you're pushing out with your hands like this? Push away--don't aim at your waffles! Push away very gently with your hands now, this way. Just make the motion first."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">She pushes her hands away from herself just a bit, and I mimic that, too, vibrating with happiness. I'M LEARNING MAGIC! It shouldn't be anything with crafting my eravahk and what I did to Eden and Earth but...in a way I had so much help those really <i>didn't</i>&nbsp;feel like mine. Whatever this spell does will be <i>me </i>doing it, even if I just give Lyra OMIFUCK I COULD CONJURE THE WIND THAT ALWAYS MAKES MODELS' HAIR BLOW DRAMATICALLY FOR REAL!</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Yes! Now move your hands but feel how they push on the air as you move them. See how it feels like they're moving through water? All of that air you feel is being moved by your hands as you push them away from yourself. Tell that air with dreamtalk to move with your hands and keep going until it gets tired of being alive and just becomes air again. Air isn't conscious, but when you act like it is, it puts some of your consciousness on it, to manifest the air responding to you how it would if it was conscious. It's just like making heartstone, which I see your game taught you in my Klapta's nursery. Just dreamtalk the air and expect it to listen and behave--you have dominant nature, tell that air to get moving! Try it, this way!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Mama turns to Isht Visht, who sits up almost proudly-hungrily like Lyra might if I started talking about blowjobs, and when Mama does the motion, Isht Visht's hair moves with a gentle puff of breeze.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I make the gesture, feel the air I'm pushing, but I can't even get the first word of dreamtalk out before the gesture is done, so of course nothing happens.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I can't dreamtalk fast enough to tell it. Like, I don't think I can even imagine words that fast!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Boobsqueeze, don't do it verbally! Do you know how you get things that just feel like you know them from your game sometimes, but you know that isn't your knowledge when you see it the first time? Your game is using a kind of dreamtalk that doesn't use words to send ideas across, that doesn't have anything but the raw thoughts in it. That's very intimate because you can't send anything meaningful to the person you're sending to unless you know exactly how their soul looks inside, but you know how your own soul looks enough to look in the mirror and pretend it's air that can hear you! Try it that way, just ideas, while your hands move. It should be instantaneous!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I try it again--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Hehe air blowing my hair!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"COOL!" I push again, harder.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Mommy that's wonderful! It feels like you touching me!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Sending the raw idea is so effortless I barely know I'm doing it. Excitement wants to squeeze out and my nakedness makes it spread a slutty grin all over me, opening my arms away from my breasts and sitting me up straight to bounce excitedly. I've been doing stuff like this since my breakdown in the cabin aboard Isht Visht, but it's easier to experience and even enjoy it here, because...it <i>does</i>&nbsp;make me sexy, doesn't it. I'm appreciating her lesson as unguardedly as a kid, she has to like that, doesn't she? She sure looks delighted!</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Boobsqueeze I'm excited! You did that wonderfully! I want to try everything with you, but let's put this aside because I understand the next piece of the prophecy! We're going to hop in waves to hair adventure, and that sounds to me like using your aetherwork to make yourself beautiful for your coronation tonight! What do you think the next part means, family, where it says for the day or week or millenium? Before I thought we might have short or long trips we can't plan the length of, which sounds fun and adventuresome to me, but now I can't see that here."</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"I mean you're not wrong, Captain, but I think it must be layered because I'm thinking TV because waves remember it uses radio on Earth because you can't just scry the original art piece. Hop in waves make me think that because remember channel surfing still makes up a lot of people's entertainment on Earth because the Internet and computers can't do video when Lucy and Lyra left--I don't mean like CD-ROM video clips I mean keeping high-res movies on like your hard drive. So <i>I </i>think we should channel surf and I'm not arguing Captain I just think we have a busy night coming. Better make some caffiene--sis can you brew Jolt? Not relevant I just have to know that is the coolest ability."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes sis I can if I have the ingredients which I bet the kitchen here has after what Rada said!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Hell yes I've always wanted to taste it made the real way! Anyway day or week or millenium sounds like how often shows came out in the 90s like every day or week or millenium because I know Earth was timebouund but I bet the wait for the second part of Best of Both Worlds felt like a millenium, right sis and Lucy? They never really tell until they get in the situation...like, don't make a schedule for viewing which I was about to because probably Lucy is going to have weird reactions to girl shows and I should be on my feet for that instead of strapping us in. What do you guys think about after that? I notice the Stormglobe changed into Stormfront--wait up Captain we got twenty lines into Berrybooth before you stopped reading! I don't see you as ice Captain but that book might be one of your command units, haven't you kinda lived hoping Lucy would come to you, like that idea commanded your life to a pretty great extent?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Klapta, imagine how Lucy feels! She's not su'khora, she isn't made to enjoy having a destiny to become anyone's fantasy! Boobsqueeze, I have been--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Mama, what if that's what's supposed to happen. What if that's what we're doing here."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Weepy terror and the pounding thought <i>what if Lyra loses her Mommy though</i>&nbsp;rush through me but they're cut with excitement and hope as I sit paralyzed by nothing but my own emotions, holding my crown to look at it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"In the Arwing I came really hard and wanted to get fucked at the same time enough that I accidentally made a heartstone dildo, and then kept making it because it's me of course, and my game like, you should probably direct that before it gets too big for you, and I was like, what if I just keep going, and it told me it'd keep transforming me so I could fit it until I was a flesh and blood condom stretched over whatever shape I'd made, and like...slut that I am there was something twistedly appealing in that idea. What if this is like that? I'm horrified at the idea of erasing the person you love so much Lyra, and who you made this wonderful house and game for, but also...like after three paragraphs of that story I was already like NEW ROLE MODEL, and I really don't understand how it can be so perfect <i>and </i>be my actual heritage, but maybe Mama you wanting me to be the Strawberry Princess so much is something I need, like the encouragement I need to become her or something. I mean cocksleeve you like it, right? This is better than just blue butterfly me? Princess Lucy was <i>naughty, </i>I never even considered that could be <i>fun</i>, but it sounded like it!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I'm your cocksleeve so what I like is to please you and make you happy whatever identity you take Mommy but Princess Lucy and Melody made you have energy to have fun times and think up adventures! It made you so wonderful I thought I would cry because I want you to have <b>fun</b>, Mommy, I don't care if you're the Strawberry Princess or a butterfly Fairy or Transformers kid Daniel or <b>anyone</b> just as long as you have fun playing with me!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The cold, hard place inside me opens out like a sad, bleak landscape, tears well up but won't even become weeping. I WANT TO HAVE FUN SO BAD WHY CAN'T I JUST DO IT!? I can play videogames and listen to stories and enjoy being taken and just simply fucking Lyra is great but...am I just not <i>creative? </i>As a Fairy do I actually only have passiveness in me? All this should be <i>alive, </i>too bright to look at--there are the tears.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">We've been running so hard and every moment has been choreographed and I see the kindness in this now because I can see how it hasn't given me time to have Lyra there <i>waiting </i>full of potential and realize that I don't think I ever learned how to <i>play </i>somehow! Yes there's been some there's been sparks but all that's done is show me how much I'm missing!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">There's no way I can possibly explain myself so I throw myself on Mama being wise enough to get the metaphors I learned from her in the first place.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Mama help, I need oxygen. Not breathing room I have that right now I need <i>oxygen</i>&nbsp;Mama do you understand&nbsp;<i>oxygen</i>&nbsp;Mama I can't seem to burn it it--Mama help me please--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Klapta, get the TV things. We're finishing our meal now. Let's go see the couch-room, everyone! Did you get enough of everything, Strawberry Tart?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">There are only a few bites of waffle left and I've eaten most of the toast I think. <i>This </i>at least will be fun. I set my crown down, lean forward and grab Lyra, and lick the fallen syrup off her breast with one slurp.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Gasp grabbing liiiick yuum</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">When I straighten from licking Lyra Mama's standing looking at me and I remember her question and nod and grab my crown again and start to shuffle out to let her--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">As smooth and quick as a cat, Mama braces hand on the edge of the table, leaps to the bench and bounces off it to vault over the table to get out (her end of the table being against the wall). That...was kind of hot. And how did I forget how I came in here!? <i>That </i>was fun! Cocksleeve, reverse procession, I want to see your ass move, poing good!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes MOMMY bounce onto fingertips then bound onto bench in front of you and bouncy bouncy bouncy wait for you to come up and start walking.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Her bouncing is SO CUTE with her tail lashing in time with it and her silvery hair bouncing. Her ass cheeks bounce with rubbery weightlessness that makes me want to thwack her into motion with my eravahk WELL THEN WHY DON'T YOU YOU STUPID FAIRY BIMBO?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I get myself up onto the bench and on the first bounce flick it out to land a nice hard whack on her ass--after all, she's not just fireproof, she's <i>bouncy</i>! Move, cocksleeve!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Bhaah WHACKED yes Mommy moving eravahk is so sexy making wet to be up here and perform bouncy along super BOUNCY!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">What is this? Did Mama do something or did I just blunder into Lyra having the ability to fan my flames after all? My mental order was sharp but giving it and the tone of it feels like being made entirely of the kind of friendly kinky fun grin I could see on both Lucy and Melody's faces in the story. We poing (thunderously, thanks to me) along the bench and onto the floor with a <i>boom</i>&nbsp;OUCH FUCK okay I guess even my breasts have a limit on how hard you can bounce them but even that makes me just feel sillier like stupid bimbo what were you expecting. I catch up to Lyra and then remember something awesome Mama did to me that's like that and definitely hurt but like not even <i>so what </i>more like GOOD, and reach over Lyra's shoulder--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Oh poor human Mommy--ooh hhhi Mommy reaching for breast AAAH turning yes follow nipple eep look up to see haa ymmm kisss...tongue slurp lick you back with my tongue HI MOMY I LOVE YOU!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Her shining silver beauty makes me sigh when I straighten from the kiss. Mama and Isht Visht, having zoomed into the camp while Lyra and I were testing the strength of the bench and porch, are now making the unmistakable sounds of unpacking and setting up "the TV stuff".</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Booooobsqueeze, come in here to play!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">It's been like five seconds!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">You were kissing me for one minute and twenty-nine seconds actually Mommy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Oh. Well it felt like five seconds. I grab both her horns to turn her--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">WHee SPIN! Yes go this way SPANKED now I'm so wet I'll get nectar everywhere Mommy!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Good! You need me so much it leaks out everywhere. I love it. We pass through to the kitchen but once again I'm too busy checking out the people in there to get a good look, and then through into the--couch room, Mama's silly-accurate name for it makes me smile.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy look Isht Visht in all of her forms it has to be!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">And it's laid out like the camp at Grand Lake! Pictures of ships from a tiny wooden sailboat to the Enterprise D (in pride of place over the couch) and a TOS Klingon Bird of Prey and massive golden-age scifi spaceliner decorate it--hah cocksleeve you're right just like the Enterprise-D's observation lounge!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">In front of the couch is, sure enough, the ancient and huge wooden toy chest we all propped our feet on to watch the first few seasons of TNG, but the long-gone lid is back, and I somehow can't imagine it's empty like it always was in Arlington...</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Mama's so old and wise I keep forgetting what huge nerds she and Isht Visht are. A flawless replica--yeah no that's just a real lightsaber sitting on a little stand on the end table, a very expensive-looking Master Sword and Hylian Shield hang on the wall, busts of various superheros sit on the kitchen table with my inaccessible Lego like--<i>oh, </i>they're <i>unpacking</i>. Good then.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">To the left replacing the gas heater is the massive fireplace from camp Monomonac, a huge stone arch out of a medieval castle, somehow fitting even though--oh. Oh my <i>god</i>&nbsp;cocksleeve. It's tricky, subtle, because I wasn't <i>that</i>&nbsp;much smaller, and the room isn't just sized for giants, but the familiar old camp's floor dimensions and <i>interestingly upgraded</i>&nbsp;furniture are stretched to make it feel as big as it did before my growth spurt finished, when I was, say, fifteen, which gives just enough space for the fireplace to fit without overtaking the room (or having there be nowhere to sit without roasting).</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">No fire is lit, but there's a huge stack of firewood--I wonder if Mama can teach me to control my light enough to start fires?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">This also gives lots of space around the furniture for...<i>playtime.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The bare-timber walls are there, though the wood is Isht Visht green now, even has the electrical wiring and junction boxes visible that fascinated me so as a kid.</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd">"Come here, look what we brought from Earth for our TV watching session, the very first printing of a very important show for you! The prophecy told me this, and I didn't realize it until we got in here! Friendship is Magic!"</p>
