<article class="chapter 89---mothership">
    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">89 - Mothership</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Outside, packing the street (but not the square of forest we have for a lawn), is a crowd like you'd get for a music festival. They have signs and streamers everything. Under the streetlight I can see the streamers are rainbow-colored and the signs have stuff like Starlight Princess the four-year-old with Boobsong in hammer-form on them.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">And here I am with my glowing face pressed up against the window and my big brilliant fairy wings spread and Boobsong beside me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I stare, feel really weird. Why aren't I hiding below the window where they can't see me?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Because they <i>did </i>see me and now they're jumping up and down and cheering--even all the way at the end of the huge yard it's <i>loud</i>--and I feel kind of weepy that they'd be so excited to see me and yeah that thing with the president was scary but I kind of did like it and this is just our fanclub projecting from the otherworld not a bunch of people who're looking to me to decide if the apocalypse is evil or not.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's like that moment in Prince Caspian. If I flub this battle, I'll flub all the other ones, except why would I want to?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I put my hand with my eravahk up and wave with it, and put a huge smile on. Wave, Boobsong!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">HI PEOPLE WAVE TO YOU!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They go even more wild, people throw glitter into the air, it's-it's-it's so <i>cute </i>let's go greet them handmaiden come on!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I straighten and head for the front door where of course they're all plastered to the window.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"We're going out. Do you want to stay secret or be introduced?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My Dad turns back first, pats Gregor who's been sharing the window with him, silently goes to the coat closet and and gets his greatcoat, hat, slips shoes on, waits ready to go. My mom goes next, comes back in her huge poofy ancient down jacket, takes his hand.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Dear me!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Mom's not kidding. Light floods in the windows by the door, blinding--hey! I can glow on my own, thanks!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: my family can't glow, so my game is arranging spotlights for them.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh. Gregor and Morton stay glued to the windows beside the door, looking out.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Does that change your mind? You don't have to. It's not like the church, it won't be weird if our family's invisible."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My Dad just adjusts his tweed porkpie hat at me, which is Dad for <i>try and stop me.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I love you too, Dad. I don't have a choice not to show it anymore but I want him to see anyway.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They look so <i>normal </i>standing there, my dad in his button-down and khakis, my Mom in her huge blouse and slacks with her hair half-up like she does when she doesn't plan on seeing anyone but the family.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Now what about you guys," I say to my brothers, remembering what it's like to be clergy kids. Mom and Dad can pull rank and decide for them, but if they try to make them go out there when they don't want to I'll just pull <i>this is my show</i>&nbsp;rank on that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"What's this, not hang the Christmas lights just because there's a crowd out there!?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Of course that's all Gregor would be thinking of. Morton doesn't say anything, but I know he'll follow Gregor.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now why does Gregor have to always take a shit in the middle of any happy family moment?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"<i>I </i>want to hang lights, but if you say they're&nbsp;<i>Christmas </i>lights&nbsp;Boobsong and me will feel terrible because it says you'd rather have the world where she doesn't exist as far as you know and I'm suicidal because everything I care about other than this family is taken away from me, and we'll leave the moment it comes out of your mouth and not come back again. If you say it to them out there they'll&nbsp;think you're Eden supporters and start trying to save me from you. If you go out there and just put lights up they'll assume they're Heartwarming lights and not think anything of it."&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Listen, though, Gregor. You guys can believe how you want to but we're not going to live in a house where people think Lyra and me are the enemy. Do you choose the religion Jesus himself told you is a bunch of lies, or your own sisters? I know you think it's funny, but it's not. Your jokes like that are cruel and the only reason you ever got away with them is that we've all had no option but to make this work as a family for the sake of our livlihood because we're a clergy family. Lyra and me don't have those constraints anymore, and the chruch is already in chaos, so you don't have that to let you get away with stuff anymore. Next time I hear you say something like that Lyra and I will be gone <i>that moment</i>--we don't need to pack or anything, remember--and it will be your fault, and if it's not in front of the rest of the family you can get to be the one to explain to them what happened because we won't be in touch until they tell my game you explained it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm breathing hard by the end of it, and shocked at myself. Having to be bare with my feelings here is a lot more complicated than with Lyra!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: I did the right thing being strict about this. This tells Boobsong how important she and our kids are to me, and stops Gregor insulting us before it starts. He's carrying our Dad's feelings about the sudden changes in everything, and if he can't that will take pressure off him he shouldn't have in the first place. It will make the family system change and surprise me. My reward is a Handel's Messiah tape done by Cherry with Heartwarming lyrics instead of the Christian ones. It's in the minivan's tape deck and playing when we start it next.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Soggy sad blueberry sprinkle gummi bears, good one, game. My anger all turns to weepy compassion as I think about how we always listened to the Messiah as a family on Christmas day while opening presents and stuff (the full version <i>takes </i>most of a day, and we have it on CD).</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now this where I'm going to <i>use </i>my weepiness this way is why I'm a princess and that's a kind of monster you can be:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>"Please</i>&nbsp;can you not, though. I don't want to leave and neither does Lyra, right Lyra?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Weepy sob. "Of course I don't! You're my family too! Just because you can see me now does that mean you want to get rid of me?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Except I'm not lying, just being heartbreaking. The idea does make us cry. I hug her closer, put an arm around her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Hound me after this--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's Gregor. He's still at the window, and his voice whines like it does sometimes, but the way he gets quiet and cuts off in the middle of the sentence feels really wrong<i>. </i>I look at my parents as if to say <i>do something. </i>They look at each other, and my dad goes over, puts his hand on Gregor's shoulder, talks to him but I can't hear what they're saying. My mom goes too, hovers nearby.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">We watch them, Boobsong and Morton and me, for what seems like hours, finally my mom comes over to talk to us. Her voice is low so the others won't hear.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"When your guardian came to talk to us she said he would need help with voices he would hear that you and Lyra have the thing for. Do you know what that means?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I look at Boobsong for a second before answering.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Ulp look at Princess yes it must mean that but how can we possibly?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Yeah, especially after that last thing. He'll never be comfortable enough around me again. Anyway, you're the <i>best, </i>but you're not even remotely the right seed-mom for him.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Maybe. Is that all she said?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">￼￼￼￼￼"She said you would be able to take him out of the danger zone."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Voices... "Oh!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">You can really fly, right? And carry both of us?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes very easily OH NO POOR GREGOR is he sick!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Lyra can turn into a pegasus and we can fly him to the hospital. We can get in line at the ER and you guys can meet us there. No, better yet, she can turn into a dragon and just carry us all--right? Will that be too much?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm whispering like my Mom, you will too snuggly.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes! If Gregor needs help let's go take me outside please Princess!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Your guardian said it was important that just you and Lyra take him when it was time for it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Alright then give me his insurance card--no, no time, if she said that. Hey Gregor, you wanna go for a dragon ride? Come on, you even have your snowpants on already and everything!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Why don't you go with them, son,"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">comes my Dad's surprising voice from where he and Gregor are still by the window. Gregor turns around, looking kind of hollow-eyed like I can now see my Dad does too. Does this all have to be so mean to them?</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"You have a dragon now!?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Gregor sounds kind of indignant, which would be cute in another situation. I move Boobsong away from my side--pluck.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Raise wings tail out to the side to show how it's dragony.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"She isn't big enough!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Not right now I'm not! I can change sizes!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"How's that possible?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Come see," I chirp. Somehow the past day and a half have changed me so I just turn up the candy cuteness the more doomful things get. It feels <i>amazing.</i>&nbsp;Without waiting anymore I march us to the door--Boobsong grab his hand--and pull it open.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Hold hand out see I'm harmless cute and don't you want to ride on me and see how I shapeshift?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Cheers and applause explode out of the crowd, fever-pitched, when the door opens on us, and I wave with my eravahk-hand reflexively, smile, it's like I've done this a million times, then look back to see if we have Gregor.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Okay grab you then.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">As soon as she has him I lead us down the steps and onto the walk. It's a crisp night, and I wish Dreams if you can hear me we could just hang Heartwarming lights as a family without all this drama. I wish Gregor would just be okay.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Psychic vision of a green checkmark? Then do something!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Start changing as soon as we have enough space, dragonpet. Get under Gregor. I'll just--just <i>fly up.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Here I come changing then tailunderGregorfastbeforehecanmoveaaCHANGERAAA</p>
<p data-voice-id="FCmxrIh5N">AAAH yes hold on good make you spikes to grab.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She covers most of the walk in dragon form. It's <i>awesome</i>, and somehow she still just as cute as she was, all feminine curves and squishy flesh instead of armored scales.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's hard to believe even with my breasts weird and heavy when I crouch to do it nectar can give me the strength to <i>fly </i>but I can feel it all through me how easy this will be. I jump, flap over and plunk behind Gregor on her back like it's nothing, and without even thinking about it kick Boobsong's sides to get her moving oh<i>&nbsp;my </i>that's kinky.</p>
<p data-voice-id="FCmxrIh5N">CHARGE! Bend my back legs rear up on them shapeshift saddle bumps to keep you where you are and <b>SPROINGGGG </b>up to where my wings can work and FLAP up high!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay if I hadn't just had a whole lot of magic demon sex this would be the coolest thing that ever happened to me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Buzz the crowd but watch the powerlines and then head for Stamford Hospital, dragonpet!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"SORRY TO JET," I belt out as we fly over them, then realize I don't have a clever quip and don't want to humiliate Gregor by saying he's in trouble, "BUT I'M IN A HURRY!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">...so <i>that </i>is how the writers of StarFox <i>CD </i>felt.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"What's that light up there?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Gregor points to a light in the distance. It zooms up impossibly fast, roars overhead and turns from glowing lights into a flying saucer that grabs us with tractor beams that make everything feel like helium fills it. In no time we're pulled inside past brilliant colorful lights and held floating in the middle of a glowy sci-fi docking bay with lots of darkness and blue-white lights while the door irises closed under us and then the beam puts us down and everything is quiet for a moment.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"What."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Hey, it's kind of Empire Strikes Back in here, like those are totally the stairs from the carbonite facilitiy...</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Gregor just sits there looking around, silent. I can't blame him, he must have a lot on his mind.</p>
<p data-voice-id="FCmxrIh5N">Wait that's Isht Visht smell! This is her Princess I'm sure of it!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh my--game don't let me laugh. You either snuggly, don't mess their scene up.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Clutch change: I can be quiet, or play confused by this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr">"Gregor Erik Harded of Stamford I95501 and Lucy Starlight-Hardred with companion Lyra collected. Engage safe-drop. Gregar Erk Hardred secured by life-rope in five...four...three...two...one...secured. Safe-drop activate."</p>
<p data-voice-id="FCmxrIh5N">What's that feeling feels so <b>good</b>&nbsp;it's like...seeds come out YAY!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">As she talks, a thing like a rappeling harness drops from the ceiling and clips itself around Gregor who's too surprised to react, and then suddenly we're falling back through the ring of lights and Boobsong is flapping to stop keep us airborne. Isht Visht turns back into colored lights and zips off impossibly fast again.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Bwahahahaha congratualtions little one!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="FCmxrIh5N">Congratulations PRINCESS! Happy Mothers' Day next year!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That's my clutch back to normal, and...it's <i>brilliant. </i>Gregor <i>loves </i>all that tinfoil hat stuff. No wonder--what--oh, Dreamtalk, still have to get used to being psychic--</p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd"><i>Don't worry, loved-one. He'll be fine in our hands. We know what's harming him. You helped implant your first since waking up, and it's your brother! Congratulations!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>Thanks! Take good care of him, I was supposed to be taking him to the hospital. Boobsong made the seeds though, and...I mean you kicking us out obviously triggered him so why isn't this Isht Visht's kid?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="LWsnJSfNr"><i>It's OUR kid you silly goose! We did a four-way!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="FCmxrIh5N"><i>EEEE THAT'S AWESOME! SAY HI KID FROM ME PLEASE?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>And me! And congratulations to you guys!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="6V23mPtyfd"><i>Thank you! We told your parents what happened so you can just go back and enjoy your evening now. Gregor's exploring his new love happily.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>I'll tell them AND SPIKING WARN ME NEXT TIME ARGH!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">When we get back to the house, my Mom is washing dishes, and my Dad is sitting at the kitchen table watching the news, which for once I don't blame him--hey, is that Isht Visht docked at the Empire State Building? Some zepplin anyway.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Ah! They're back!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My Mom puts her washing down and my Dad gets up from the table. Morton is holding our cat Leif at his spot and stays put, looks at us shyly, and I've thought <i>you're next </i>before I can stop myself. Mom and Dad both seem to want hugs, so I give them, and my Mom looks at Boobsong after--hug her sweetly, little one.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Hi Princess' Mommy hug you!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">When they let go, my Dad says,</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"How's that tea, love? Get more mugs out, eh?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Mom bounces off to get mugs--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"You guys are the ones who need a break. Mom, sit just this once. Lyra, find out who wants tea and fetch them the mugs and stuff."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">All those memories and stuff were <i>so right. </i>I really can't stop. It's all just too much <i>fun</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">As she turns to my startled parents, I march over to the stove, touch the outside of the steaming water-pot with a fast hand, find it hot in a way I know would burn me if I was a normal human, but doesn't, pick it up in both hands and face my family I shine nice toasty infrared from my fingers into the metal until after a couple of seconds the water is boiling furiously.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">May I Take the water now so I can pour the tea please?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Handing it to me. Bwaha take it by the hot part see I'm fireproof too! Carefully each mug perfectly right don't spill anything or let the teabag handle get any water...pan to sink and back to you hi hold me now EEE hugs pets!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Once we're all sitting with Boobsong on my knee to give me mint tea, I blurt:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"So after tea, want to go for a dragon ride, Morton?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Will your fans come back?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I can't tell if he's hopeful or scared or both.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"No, I said we need family time. They'll stay away until we make some kind of appearence."</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Okay, then!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Fizzfreezing sparklepops self what are you doing he's <i>twelve--</i>yes,&nbsp;and just what's wrong with a twelve year old having a totally awesome dragon ride? That's all <i>I'm</i> planning for. Stuff just seems to <i>happen</i>.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Out into the moonlit back yard, like we should have done with Gregor, Morton bundled up and walking out the back porch door with us, something feels off to me...okay not sure why exactly but:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Would you rather have a pegasus ride than a dragon ride? She can do that, too."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">You can carry two in ponyform, right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">If I scale it so I can lift you I can carry all of our family! I'd be as big as dragon-form then though.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I lead us out into the yard. Morton stays quiet until we're in the middle of the grass.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"What's her pony shape like? Does she have feathers or bat-wings still?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Check it out. Change, snuggly!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">AAaaaaAAAAHHCHANGINGPoNFORM! Clop hooves on the grass it feels so good under them.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">SEEDS ALREADY <b>WOW </b>OKAY HERE THEY COME OUT HAAAHPOP!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">What!? We haven't even got on you! Congratualtions but--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My Mom startles when we walk back into the kitchen so soon and without Morton.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"So um, the minivan seats eight, right?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">And like that the writing journey pops and we're back on the whaleship--holy sugar snap Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman celebrity cookbooks. Seer wake up and read me this part here. Out loud.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"including how I'm the Rider of CONQUEST AND <b>EASTER BUNNY</b>&nbsp;<b><i>WHAT!?</i>&nbsp;</b>RAUDA IS SHARON AND <b>DEATH!? </b>This is true Princess I perfectly remember it but <b>WHAT!? </b>Who are the rest of them if you're the Easter Bunny is one of them like Santa Claus who's the other then like a general something? What's Rauda do is she the Great Pumpkin <b>oh my pinchy nippleclamps she would like that totally. </b>This very respectful cocksleeve doesn't mean to make fun of this but how can--you would never make up all that it must be right I remember it it's just so crazy Princess I have to express how weird it feels to hear you just say all that!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"The Dreams were pushing me super hard to hurry and just write that all without thinking. I can see why, holy swirly end-of-the-world freezerpops in a nest of-of-Sugarfeast grass."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Ack here we go <i>this </i>is going to be epic--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--sunrise, the world is black with the interference-pattern weirdness of conflation jump, Boobsong's playing handmaiden for me hiding candy I'm conjuring out of nowhere like in that imaginary Narnia journey and handing to her like it's oh my fizzfrozen holiday special commemorative creme eggs <i>Easter Eggs--</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--now I'm handing blindingly colorful baskets from a table behind me to Boobsong and she walks them into a conflation-jump journey of millions of doorsteps at once so they copy each to the right family for the mood that basket gives me to conflation-jump through ARGH DREAMS YOU HAVE GOT TO BE FIZZFREEZING <i>KIDDING</i> ME--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--squeezing candy shapes out of the tip of Boobsong's tail like a pastry bag onto silicone baking sheets to make nectar candy to put in the baskets. We gave brand-name stuff too because I mean come <i>on </i>pixie stix if you can make literally just eating sugar with a little flavor dust interesting the <i>Sugarfeast</i> Fairy is sure going to honor you but the nectar was the important part because it was healing yes but also you could eat the entire basket in one single sitting and not get a stomachache and that's the spirit of sugarfeast being able to take the good stuff and just have it totally unrestrainedly without paying the price it would cost you "naturally" because breaking the game you were born into is important if you're an Earthling--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--oh <i>my </i>that's exactly one of those carboard Santa Clauses but it's <i>me </i>in my Starlight Princess outfit making my heart-hands sign and it's hanging in a store window with a big dragon-Boobsong next to it--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--flying through the night on Boobsong with city lights far below, the camera chopper from before is in front of us (we've just been making live Dreamskins in the Rainbow Cathedral, that was a Sugarfeast celebration), we dip to line up with the lens of the camera under its nose and then the world goes weird with conflation jump--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--nighttime, plastic tulips glowing in a window, colorful but closed, Boobsong's curves on the near side of the glass, she looks at the tulips and turns to me. They're out of their buds but not open, so I hand her a basket for young teenagers three times one for each tulip, the world is weird with conflation jump because we're doing this at tens of thousands of houses with three young teenagers--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--more conflation-jump weirdness, thousands of living rooms and desks all with different arrangments of flowers, some just buds, some blooming wide, some in the middle like those tulips were, seen through a blur of zillions of different kinds of frame, round-cornered and square-cornered and tall and and wide and some views cracked or scuffed--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--a big shiny-iridescent rainbow-striped box like a Heartwarming present <i>wait a minute</i>&nbsp;I reach out for it and the vision breaks but the box there heavy in my lap on the whaleship just begging me to open it!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">YAY It worked let's open it Princess!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Yeah! It's a huge box, but I manage to get off the chair where Boobsong can slip out from between me and it and take it and set it down and open it up which is what you're going to do, handmaiden.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I kneel in front of it as she obeys, ready to peer in like in that memory.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">In the top of the box is a huge book, shining rainbow-iridescent like the box but darkly silver except it has my shining rainbow heart sign on the outside of it, diagonal-striped and candy-looking with rays of light streaming out behind. I pick it out and hug it to my chest, can't open it so hug it a little more, then hold it out to Boobsong.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"First page."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Take the--wait I <b>remember </b>this! Turn it around open first page for you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's a picture of me and Boobsong, both naked, standing in the front window of a tour bus, draw in what has to be Boobsong's style and carefully colored in with anime brilliance on shiny black heartstone "paper".</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Below it, is black-mirror-style text, the rainbow glory I've been putting into the big black mirror when I'm not remembering being blue-ized on one side and Boobsong's cute scribbles on the other:</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess and me riding out of Bar Harbor on the day we started this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The tour bus is leaving stately-slow so everyone can see us. Their eyes on my body feels awesome. Have you tried being naked in a place like this one? If you haven't find a place you can try it!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">How have we come so far in nine months? It seems almost yesterday I was waking up in my bed with you saying my name and making me realize I'd never heard it before.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Eighteen years ago I was born in a castle, fell through a time-warp three hundred thousand years forward, and here we are on a tour bus naked heading to Mars Hill to claim the Ouija board that's owing us. That's a crazy story and I don't even believe it entirely, but it's nothing compared to what's been happening since that day in November when you came back to me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This book has a record of everything since you woke me then. We'll start with the moment you said hi to me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I stop reading.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Okay we're reading every word of that! Put it aside now. What's the next thing?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Carefully close it and set it beside me. Waiting for to see what you want me to take next.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The next thing is a rainbow-colored kite, small enough to be in the box assembled, delta shaped, string around a kite-reel beside it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Show me that."&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Pick up the kite and string and hold it carefully out for you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Weepiness wells up, because I know what a box of my keepsakes looks like and it kills me not to remember them. That must be why the book was on top of it. It explains what everything <i>is </i>in here. I just want to know if my collar's here, mainly, the rest we can read about snuggling in the bed back there and take our time going through them. Dreams can you show me?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A falling coin splits in two, goes two ways. This went one way, my collar went the other way. Then we should read the book and get my collar probably because of the memories in it, and go through this stuff as we come to it in the story.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Put the kite back for now, but we're going to fly it soon.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Carefully lay it back where I found it. I really can't wait Princess I can feel memories there and they're happy ones! Let's just start reading now!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Eep the visions weren't finished yet--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--candles, a place like a church but underground, so many candles around the walls are golden with their light, mosaic pentagram underneath us like thirty feet wide, all of it is centuries old, someone in a purple velvet robe in front of me makes my heart-hands gesture very officiously with their hands starting high and slowly making the shape in front of their heart after passing down over their face which is hard to see in the candle-light and hood, a golden incense burner on a chain swings to the side of them--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--a tiny black mirror in a fold-over case like a wallet in my hand. I hold it high for cameras to see and a crowd in front of me stares up <i>there's an Apple logo on the back of it!?--</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--Boobsong's legs spread wide in a split and her puffy purple bubblegum pussy right in front of me, I look up over her, she's stuck to a pentagram on an altar with a place cut out to stand between the legs of the star. She looks back with that adorable <i>I'm doing a good job right </i>expression when I see her face, then I look up further to see a dark-iridescent place like the temple I collared her in and more of those purpled-robed people watching. At least one is holding a black mirror like I had in the previous vision like they're trying to catch Boobsong's picture with it--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--Now looking out over a crowd of those purple-robed people giving some kind of speech or something. We're in another iridescent cavern oh my fizzfreezing dollar bill sugartassels this is why they're called the <i>Illuminati </i>isn't it--</p>
