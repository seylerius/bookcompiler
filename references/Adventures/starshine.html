    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">77 - Starshine</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Cocksleeve, what did you <i>make </i>me?&nbsp;And--I'm sorry this really is the ultimately coolest thing ever I just have some stuff on my mind--what will this do that you can't?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes Mommy that means TARDIS mode activated while it was coming back it must mean we need to go back to the past but I made this for fun not because it can do anything I can't take you by journeying!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The game picks my thoughts for me suddenly, making me think carefully about what's happening. I need to make sure my words at the courtyard keep everyone from deciding to turn the key to paradise only part of the way, but my mother needs absolution from any wrongdoing. If I say anything softer about turning the lock on the door to paradise who knows what could happen--it's like Nintendo and Sony, you have to put the fear of my wrath in them even though my threat was probably empty (Genesis games depressed me)--but I can't leave my mom waiting for the Strawberry Goddess' wrath to take her! The only acceptable way is <i>before</i>&nbsp;I wake the castle with Lyra, so how do I make <i>that</i>&nbsp;happen?<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Don't leave me there, game! How <i>do </i>I make that happen? TARDIS mode. I was already planning to go back with Lyra, so it can't be telling me to time-travel. Could we like, go back to my family watching Doctor Who together? Seven years too late at the earliest. One single second without the absolution of the Strawberry Goddess in hand is too long.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Idea, cocksleeve!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I don't want to scare you Mommy but I think we need to go somewhere physically."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I let out a long breath.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Okay. Are you willing to die for this?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Mommy why are you saying that? We'll get back, I know we will!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I don't, and I can't, and if we don't, I'll fall apart like you've been desperately trying to save me from. We need to go to the Strawberry world before we went there last time, and this can--wait, I thought you said this can't do anything you can't? Explain, cocksleeve."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I can take you journeying how you did the Strawberry Empire ending or I can take you physically but the TARDIS only goes places physically it's not for journeying. I can't take you back to the Strawberry World that I know of and I don't think it can either but maybe we can go somewhere in the past of Rl'yeh Sade and leave her a prophecy before the Strawberry world .sinks out of reach of musing?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"We can do it without leaving the Four Dreams!? Does that even need the Waifu come on let's just go cocksleeve what do you have in mind? If it's the Dreams we'll defintely get exactly back, right?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes Mommy that's why I said I know we can and remember you can't leave anyway your game doesn't let you because it always needs to have the Dreams watching it. No I can take you and would like that if it would please you being your pegasus is so romantic Mommy I love it! Yes they will take our time-travel and squeeze us in at a timelike intersection point like with Rarity it will be right and appropriate for what's happening. That's not exactly back but just like they protect us from bad things and make reality happy they make you come in when it's time for it so I say that's better than exactly. I don't have in mind a particular time we should go just back enough to say things to the Strawberry Dynasty. It's what we should say that's confusing me! How can we make sure your Earth-mom understands it?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Just like the prophecy we've been doing. Intruiging and completely impossible to figure out until the right thing happens. How does this work, though? If Lovecraft made his writing out of <i>this</i>&nbsp;paradise, I'm thinking musing might not be so reliable for this kind of thing!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"It's not but maybe we can dreamtalk to someone directly and make them write down what you say to them."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"We're so about to found the original Strawberry Dynasty, aren't we."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Oh probably the way this seems to be going."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Is it even possible to dreamtalk with strangers? Don't we have to know them first?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Mommy where did the Strawberry Dynasty start worshipping the goddess they thought you are? Why don't we try going back and seeing if one of the high priestesses calls you? The Dreams will insert us when it's time if we head for it!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Did--I can remember, they they had the idea of anscestor worship, they thought I was their <i>grandmother!</i>&nbsp;That's why it worked for me to talk about coming back from paradise, they thought I was the first Strawberry Queen! Won't that mean they get whoever <i>was, </i>though?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Not with the intention they'll set I bet! Especially not if first we go back further and make the idea of a Strawberry Queen happen! Then you <b>will</b> be the first Strawberry Queen! That can be musing it's simple and super much sexy! Then we can go forward again and let the high priestess call you and you can give the prophecy and she'll definitely just call you and listen because you're her goddess. Comw on Mommy let's do it!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"What's the musing like? Do we need my book from upstairs or something?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Shake no.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Just what you have in me, Mommy, someone who worships you to send the right feeling out!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Alright, do it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Hang on tight Mommy!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">RRRAAAAAH <b>PRAH!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">In a flash, we're on a rock in the True Sea, but there's no sign of the hangar or house.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Sending musing out...rrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah....<b>PRAH!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The waves and moon change position but we're still on a deserted rock--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">In my third eye the image of a firelit face, lifted and crying out in ritual intensity throbs--it's worked! Game PAUSE!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Nothing happens. Game this is important, <i>please</i>! Are you not able to?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: it's perfectly able to pause here, but I need the hurry to make the prophecy right.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Game fuck you so much there's going to be trouble after this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I turn towards the face mentally and her voice dreamtalks thunderously into my mind:</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW"><i>«Hear me call, Mother of the Family Strawberry! Speak into my heart giving wisdom to the guidance of your legacy!»</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Fuck that's not English how can I understand it gah later um try motherly she's clearly expecting epic--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>I answer, daughter. Hear well, and record every word I say to you faithfully, and let not one word of my prophecy fall from the your mind or be changed, for the legacy of our line turns upon these words! In the final hour of our world the agony of a daughter abandoned shall split the heavens with its scream and wake all to mercy, yet this is the fulfilling of our line, not its ending! This I tell you for the comfort of all our people, that they shall rejoice when night turns to day and the sky bursts asunder, not cower in fear! Yet I tell you the rest secretly, to be held for only the daughters of the Strawberry Dynasty and no others! Keep it secret! Keep it safe! Should one word be lost or change our line comes utterly to ruin and the last queen of our house shall live cowering like a thief to be hanged! Here is what I say, do you hear me, daughter?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW"><i>«Yes, Mother! I shall record as you command it! My pen stands at the inkwell as a soldier awaiting the battle-cry!</i>»<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Oh my god, we really are all as melodramatic as I am.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Words of judgement and doom shall ring from the heavens, and I appear in wrath, yet my compassion will kindle at the sight of our people, our poor children lost and confused. I--</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">This is why it wouldn't give me time to prepare game you <i>bastard </i>this is <i>wrong </i>I could have <i>prevented </i>everything<i>--</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>--bring them our comfort yet already the final queen of our line shall in her wisdom have fled beyond the sight of even her anscestors, and so she must have in her hand my prophecy that under other stars she has comfort that her actions bring only my care and compassion upon her:</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>One ring down a rickety stair on the mountaintop, green as the leaves of a strawberry.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>As stranger in this strange land many tales shall be told of what was done and left undone though it was only a moment past.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>All shall pound like the blood in a hot summer's night!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>You will hear in them of the world you call home from afar ending in judgement and fire, and rejoicing to see our sky breaking open with judgement upon the key in the lock you have turned just moments ago, told as legends by fireside. They will say of you that your eyes failed to see what was before them! That you were blind, and a fool, and my wrath is upon you!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Hear now this plainly without riddle: you are not, you are wise, and I have no wrath for you, only the love one bearer of the Strawberry Crown has to another and moreso for you in particular are precious to me. In the final hours, you--</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">My thoughts choke. Game I hate you <i>FUCK YOU </i>we could have fixed this properly why did you railroad me into this halfassed shit!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>--made the greatest of sacrifices for what you hold most dear, and now live with it. It was not you which failed, but the world which sank out of sight of the very stars themselves, and for this the world was unmade, you had no hand in it! Is even the Strawberry Queen so great she directs the hands of her ancestors? Take peace in this, and when you hear strange tales of us, know that your action has spread the name of Strawberry so that it covers the sky like diamonds! Next to this any empire is but the tiniest ember!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Game help the crown I'm right right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: I made the crown appear in&nbsp;Soefta'xrn. Tell her what the plan I make up is, and Mama will have the crown arrive like we remember.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">But something is hard in me. I've underestimated all of this once, I won't do it twice. This story can be better. Cocksleeve, get ready to recite me the Five Pointed Star. You'll know when.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes Mommy I hear you I don't think we can though.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Slip.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"AAAH! LET ME FIX THIS WHAT THE FUCK WRONG WITH YOU MY SWEET SEEDLING DIDN'T BUILD A MONSTER LIKE THIS!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Slipslipslipslipslipslip--</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING BASTARD YOU'RE <b>EVIL</b>&nbsp;IT'S ALL OF US NOT JUST HER! FUCK YOU FUCK YOU <b>DIE! </b>Dreams help this is <i>wrong</i> you can't let it do this you can't let it make me this horrible!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Green checkmark.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"YOU CAN'T GREEN CHECKMARK THIS DREAMS THE REST OF THAT STUFF WAS KINKY AND TERRIFYING BUT IT WAS <i>GOOD</i>&nbsp;THIS IS <i><b>EVIL</b></i>&nbsp;YOU'RE MAKING ME DO WHAT I'M HERE TO SAVE MY MOM FROM THINKING SHE DID!!!!!!!!!! WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ALL OF YOU SUDDENLY!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">They just show me my Earth-mom and a LaVerdier's bag and Isht Visht and another green check mark.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Fine. Have to hurry so I'm doing this, but you <i>failed </i>today, Dreams. I shouldn't be able to imagine better than you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh"><i>Now hear: as the last of your household descends, from the winds of a far land will ride up a chariot fit for a child's toy, fine and thin as fine silk and crackling with strange doom. One must remain to greet it, and in their hand be the crown of our family, for it passes now as our empire ends to be the ransom which will one day save the last of our line who descends with you now and will grow to the fulfillment of our legacy in safety yet need rescue one day. That one may remain behind while others flee without fear, for they pass into paradise that day without passing through death. In their hand as they enter, must be our crown in its chariot, for on this all hangs. In paradise is a land ruled by horses where hands are a strange sight. In this land one polishes her ship with a mother's love and a lover's fury--strange power will make the way to this straight and the time right. It is to this mother of a boat that the ransom is given, but all is undone is if their hand is seen, or it arrives without its chariot which is the greater part of the ransom! They shall set the crown in the chariot on the waves toward her, and flee into whatever arms of paradise are sweetest to them and rest well in them forever, for they have done our line a greater service than any from its beginning to end, and shall be called champion by any who learn what they have done.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Knowledge: I can't be responsible because I tried to be good as I see it, and the game didn't let me go through with it. I did the best thing I could do. It's taking me back now, or I can make Lyra.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I feel dizzy and sick, cockeyed like I'm sliding off Lyra even though I'm holding on tighter than I ever have. Game don't you fucking touch me you disgusting monster I don't know what you are and why the Dreams aren't protecting me from you but you damn well aren't anything Lyra made.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Cocksleeve, take us home. Aim for the exploding room."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><b>PRAH </b>yes the exploding room!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">The scene changes, and we're in total darkness with no sound of walls nearby.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Girl form and hold on you know what happens next."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">AAaaahhchaaange grab you so hard hugs I can take the heat ready.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">But no light comes. I teeter, but Lyra's strong in the darkness, holding me soft and warm so I don't fall. Sobs wrack me, I wretch but don't have anything to wretch <i>with </i>and even the ice cream seems to already be gone from inside me, would stagger, think I'll scream so even the Exploding Room shatters, but nothing comes of it, I can feel the tears all over my face and the snarl etched into it and bless the mercy of this darkness.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Finally I can sobbingly growl:</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I want. Some fucking. <u style=""><i><b>EXPLANATIONS!</b>"</i></u></p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Nothing happens for a moment, which shows they're paying attention at least.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"And before. Before anyone gets any. <i>IDEAS. </i>The only good person I can see here whose words mean anything at all is Lyra, so everybody else just BUTT OUT. Cocksleeve I'm sorry to put this on you but some kind of fucked up monster pretending to be your game has been making me think you made it and the Dreams are letting it and I'm sure you've been--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Interrupt Mommy you told me please listen. Your game is the game I made you believe me it is Mommy I see what it's doing I understand why it wouldn't let you try to send the Five Pointed Star to her. You can't be responsible yes like you said to your preistess mom you can't direct how this happens you just had to play your part in this. The Dreams let it happen because that's how we came here, Mommy! If you don't send the crown to&nbsp;Soefta'xrn&nbsp;and have your mom go to Earth none of the things that you saw in the journies will be true and it all falls apart you can see that I see you can! Just listen please listen I see you interrupting--Mommy everything can't always be perfect. The Dreams make things as good as they can be always they never leave back anything just like sis said the Enterprise can beam you up or you can't help it. This was the best it could be and you're not responsible for fixing it just playing your part in it and not even that your game makes you so you can just be a little for Rada and Mommy for me."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I stand there just holding her held up by her sobbing for what seems like years. Declarations of violence and doom and taking time apart piece by piece and figuring out how to <i>actually</i> become a goddess so I can fucking fix this properly bubble up and die on the vine one after another and I sob in strange pathetic I-don't-know-what as I start to realize I'm not going to do any of them or even declare this isn't good enough or hate myself for not trying to do anything about it or even be disappointed in myself for just accepting this or think the game is evil or the Dreams have failed or <i>anything</i>&nbsp;or even feel selfish for wanting to just go upstairs to Mama and Isht Visht.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Finally, of all things, I blurt:</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"I want my--my Starlight Princess outfit. Do you think I can wear it still?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Tears flood out of me when I realize I can remember our show's name, and with it, my own name--the other way of saying it. The one <i>I </i>liked.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"I bet you can Mommy your jacket is fine! You don't need nanotubes to sit on a Starfleet couch and it was that silky remember?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"This is so stupid I want the one we made dreamskins in there's no way that's anywhere is there?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Mommy why is that stupid that was so special! Where did you put the game I know you saved them like Olympic Pizza! Here Starlight Princess things!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Her cute summons makes me giggle through my tears.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Here Mommy I have them! We need light though don't we?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Something is hanging against my ass in her hands where she's hugging. I want so hard to believe it feels familiar.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Dreams I wish the first light in here could be my rainbow stockings glowing as Lyra puts them on me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">They don't respond, but--do I remember how to do this? Is this allowed? Yes, I think my game always let me do stuff like aetherwork because it made me so happy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Keep it clean but get my jacket off. We're going to have to clean it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Take hands off you and place outfit over my wings to hang. Feel Mommy to find jack edge Mommy hi pushing around take it off you in back pull it down clean it off now right Mommy? Yes I see you say liiiiick umf cum yummy stayed fresh it's delicious.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Clean me too. Do we have a way to take makeup off?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Don't you want to see what it looks like first? You can have me do makeup anytime but this makeover was special!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Indecision makes me sob. This is the darkest it's been since this started but I remember myself and want to bring the lights up on Lyra painting my face and dressing me because I know <i>exactly </i>who I want to "come back" as now that I've seen our life together...but Mama and Isht Visht worked hard on this stuff and I can feel their love in it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">It's just...I'm not the Strawberry Dynasty's final heir, not exclusively, or more like, the Dynasty has changed entirely. The castle and empire is gone and I'l never have the human daughter necessary to carry the line on according to tradition, but Lyra and I already have more seedlings than there are stars in Earth's sky.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I'm the Starlight Princess. The name of the show was my idea. That's not strawberry makeup--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">&nbsp;"Mommy I think you should see what you look like. Please will you trust me I see why you feel like this."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Yet I still can't decide. My hunger to have Lyra carefully dab the stars onto my cheeks like she used to feels absolute, and yet--</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I laugh. My couch at the photo shoot wasn't black so they could photoshop the palace in. It was black so they could shine the stars through it, the way energon cubes glowed with something that wasn't cheap Saturday morning animation.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">It's just that I don't want to turn the lights on yet--oh. Hold still, cocksleeve, and show me how I look to you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">[ Vision: multi hair color stripes with sparkles through all your hair but mostly still light blonde. Curly falls from head with top as big fluff to match your curls size. Hair reaches down to waist and shines glowing when your light shines. Makeup far down cheeks of sparkly yellow-white shimmer and golden stars all over cheekbones with rays of eyeliner sparkly grey match your coloring out from eyes like they're shining light. Eyeshadow makes eyes look like galaxies and shimmers tiny specks all over like tiny stars so small millions have space. Big supernova rays from your forehead now, like StarFox CD novabomb. Eyes are like rainbow circles with every color iris in pie-slices. Wings are orange yellow green blue indigo purple back to indigo fading stripes like the irises of your eyes coming out of your back fairy-shaped instead of butterfly and softly translucent and glow very brightly from inside how your light is inside you ]</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy it's so beautiful.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Her single thought about it is flat, facedown with awe and adoration, but I'm weeping for another reason too.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">They knew. I'd assumed they must do some insane loopy Strawberry motif that would delight me with its sheer bombasticness, but no, they just did<i>&nbsp;me. </i>Lyra didn't do this, but she could have, and the supernova on my forehead is both appropriate and surprising, carries the joy of someone who loves you seeing what you don't see in yourself.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">Hah! It was in my eyes! Show me that again--no, grab you, open you to the page and <i>look</i>.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">[ showing same vision ]</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">That. Is the&nbsp;<i>coolest.</i>&nbsp;I must have&nbsp;<i>blown minds</i>&nbsp;in the courtyard of my castle! No wonder they thought I was some kind of strange alien goddess!</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">My rainbow eyes being back somehow changes everything.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Melody." It's her name just much as Lyra, but what I never truly got is that she's the music and the harp as one being, it's good to see that now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Gasp called me Melody--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Yes Mommy here I am!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"It's showtime. Get me ready. Do I have any stray cum? Be thour-ough! You'll have to follow your nose."</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">I singsong the <i>thorough</i> sexily, already smiliing like old times.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Hehe put your jacket down on the ground and stop cleaning it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Snif all around very carefully. Here cum, I'l eat you!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Snif...finding some...there you are liiick snif...</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">A few drops have dripped off my jacket to make my waist wet, but that seems like it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="iQnvsjJRh">"Now yourself. Clean enough to dress me? I don't think we're <i>starting </i>with cum this time."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Bwaha yes Mommy I hear <b>starting</b> lash my tail.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Sniffing all around self got some here and there hugging liiick everything clean.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Mommy I'm ready for--Mommy you're glowing see!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's light in here, cool and gentle, and the first thing I can see is Lyra standing ready, hands behind her back and face down submissively but eyes unable to stay off me. Her arched back displays her breasts, the swells of her hips stand out against her arms behind them, and her pussy shines soft and inviting, covered in nectar. Just the simple sight of her standing there makes me as horny as all the Fairy bimbo magic in all of Dream. My light surges to see her, but though it grows bright enough to see by and show our surroundings, there's none of the noonday-summer brutality my rage has. This light is my happiness, it just lets you see what's beloved to you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Well, and my lust, which makes anything sexy really <i>stand out </i>if you see it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I cry more to see it again, remember what my rainbow motif <i>meant</i>--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"You good little mischevious demon! You went to my closet instead of the Exploding Room!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The hyperoptical mirror is blurry-distorted to my right, we're just out of it's focus.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Mommy I think the Four Dreams changed where I was taking you I did mean to go to the exploding room like you told me to."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I glance around, thrilled, this was exactly where we needed to be. Glowstones on the crystal-cave ceiling in little glassy upside-down flower stems wait for Lyra to sing to them, behind us the sparkly maze of my Collection's mirrorwalk-closet beckons, the princess-chair and table for makeup are there, everything is right where it should be familiar and comforting from years of play-journies. It's not that sudden explosions of events and episodes flash past me like after each of the journies...this is just <i>home</i>&nbsp;to me, I know it, am drawn here like, heh, the smell of Olympic Pizza.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Which we're going to introduce Rarity to, because if Mama wants to mess with her and she's horrified by our house that will <i>definitely </i>get her, won't it, sexysong?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Bwhaahaha yes Mommy it so will!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Lash swish don't move my wings though!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Alright cocksleeve sing those glowstones up and get busy."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My light's shining bright and kind, a few glowstones won't upstage me now!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My eyes widen as the memory surfaces and Fox's fullly-voice-acted (you really can fit so much <i>game </i>in 500 megabytes!) dialouge fills my mind's ear with its delightful cheese.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>"Let's rock and roll!"</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes--Mommy I miss your name now that you called me Melody.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Don't make a request just say it there.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Eeep glowstones--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Zzp. I nearly forgot!&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"First of all, cocksleeve, <i>you</i> need to bow for your Princess. You know how."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Eee put clothes on floor clean in here don't have to worry now.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Kneel on my feet and head to floor palms out wait for you to make me get up or be stepped on so sexy please it makes my pussy wet just to think abooout!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Instantly my whole body feels like it's gone as sensitive and morning-wood hard as my pounding clit is now. I breathe hard and just stare at the gorgeous sight of her kneeling there.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"You'll have to be really good and ob-sequi-ous grovelly if you want to get stepped on, bedpet. You remember. Now say my name, with all my titles, and yes I am your Mommy but you call me Princess or Lucy--if you feel daring--now."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It comes out gaspy a little because I'm breathing hard with lust and happiness. The kid-speak thing is so silly <i>fun!</i>&nbsp;Instead of squishing my power it just makes the whole thing kinker. You're nothing but a kid princess' doll, cocksleeve, I hope you like getting <i>played with.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Lucy Princess of Starlight Luthier of Dreamstruments Last Heir to the Strawberry Dynasty Sage of Five Seasons Grand Chancellor of the Springtime Council Miss Very Nice Boobs Says Her Cocksleeve Mistress of StarFox."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Good." The silly titles make me grin wide even as I pound with royal authority, remembering she had to amuse me or do something <i>interesting </i>to get a title. <i>Has</i>&nbsp;to.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I squat before her and pick her face up to look at me by a horn, smiling but hard like I just dare her to even slightly wiggle and see what happens, but she's liquid compli-ance and tingles wash over me just to see her eyes fight between staring in adoration and showing her submission by being downcast.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"<i>You,"</i>&nbsp;I announce haughtily, gazing down my nose at her, "need to be on all fours in front of that mirror <i>right now. </i>You know the spot."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Horn let free turn and crawl see obsequious find the right spot and stop in it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess I'm ready please use me I'm so just hungry for pleasing you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I stand and follow her, my light more than enough to see our play by. Our huge reflection warps into focus as we step into the mirror's space, and she rises to just the right height when I find the sex-altar's psychic interface and pull it up.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Hot you're standing to take me that feels awesome it makes me feel so submissive I'm kneeling you're standing so simply hot YUS.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Well, if you <i>feel </i>submissive, you'll have an easy time showing your Princess your obedience, won't you?"<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Game, put my clit on my mound.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Purply-pink tentacles appear, hold my hips still for a moment while another snakes aroooound my clit yes this is the fun way for this and plucks to out of its pocket universe to be <i>stuck </i>on my mound with an enjoyable smack, then make me gasp by caressingly letting go of me and disappearing.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Princess yes I will!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Put my head down eyes up peek at you out of eyelashes flirty submissive and wave my ass hi your cocksleeve is waiting to be fucked like you want just say I'll be good for you.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Her pussy stands out with inner lips en-engorged so full and smooth they look like her face's full and purple. I dip my fingers in and take a taste of nectar, then come around in front of her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Haaah <b>PRINCESS!</b>"</p>
