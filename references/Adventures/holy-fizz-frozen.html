<article class="chapter 92---holy-fizz-frozen">
    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">92 - Holy Fizz Frozen</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The new briefing screen that comes up ahs a picture of a girl with curly brown hair and a hard expression on her strong, intense-looking face, fire in her eyes--ooh. I've wanted to see the world burn and I see that on her face now. The video beside her face looks like some kind of rescue, and it keeps my attention while the narrator blabs:<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A red helicopter cockpit, then looking down on a Coast Guard rescue copter hovering low over the water, winching someone in a stretch up from a life raft. Hospital hallway, respirator pumping, tubes and wires. Girl in a hospital gown learning to walk with a walker but she's young or at least not old. Her face, IV bag beside her, young and fresh, she's a teenager at the oldest. A sailor's hat seen from above, stars of rank on a shoulder pad of a white uniform, captain of a ship at a podium seen from the ranks of new crew, the injured girl turns to face the view--she's part of the crew now--and her eyes are molitov cocktails waiting for the right moment to throw.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The scene morphs and we're watching from behind her onstage in a dark concert hall. She's jumping around at the edge of the stage, singing to something bouncy, the ringing trippiness of Christian worship music.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The scene changes again and we're looking at her in a hospital gown looking out a rainy window. Empathy pangs and more of my endless tears choke me because it brings up memories just of the&nbsp;<i>emotion&nbsp;</i>of all the times in the bad timeline I sat and looked out that window knowing I was Princess Starlight and being as broken from my beauty and light as her legs must be right now--the stage was "only" in her imagination, but not if we can help it, right sidekick?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">RAAAH LET'S DO THIS THING!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Damn right game I'm mashing start never mind who this is or why we'll figure that out after we help her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Error fuzzbeep!? The text below her face flashes to say we have to read it first:</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"By creating four sexy Riders of the Apocalypse you can open a portal to Earth the Four Dreams can use to move it to the True Sea where you can relive your honeymoon with help from your game to make you ageplay that wouldn't be possible leaving Earth where it currently ends."</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"In two thousand four Marlene 'Cherry Pop' Starr is most likely to become War. Give her a helping hand and she'll instead become the <i>Rider</i> of War and make it become solidarity with everything."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Sweet strawberry abduction beams <i>that's </i>how my collar--start sound, <i>good luck </i>voice, and we're in journey.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A white TV screen, the girl eating popcorn, the scrufty sense of a college apartment, she has her feet up on a couch with crutches nearby, the long-term kind with arm-braces instead of the cheap kind you get when you sprain your ankle. Some pop star on the screen with sunglasses and a fluffy fur coat, the girl lying down and curling up. Now we see her from couch-level, lying on her side staring at the pizza boxes and dirty glasses around, and memory of someone I knew who lived with constant pain explains her empty eyes: she hates living this way but it hurts too much to keep her house clean.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Damn the frozenness of time. One day I'll shine so bright I melt all of it and the Dreams can just fix everything. Just <i>watch me. </i>What I did to Eden trying to make timelines without Boobsong was a dimass spark, you'll see.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">For now, we skate along looking for the crack.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Princess Toadstool's dress, a game of Smash Brothers, we see the girl playing, her face is still cold but the controller creaks in her white-knuckled grip, its analog stick bending like taffy as she forces it. She looks up, we see her struggling to the door of her apartment on her crutches, then Managing the other way, pizza in her hand.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Then she's sitting at her table with her head down, pizza open but untouched, too sick and exhausted with the pain of getting that far to eat.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now she's throwing up in her bathroom. She wipes her mouth, breathes hard a moment, and says:</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"Beelzebub 'r Jesus 'r&nbsp;<i>somebody</i>&nbsp;get me out of this--JESUS FUCK HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE!?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">And like that we're standing in her wheelchair-sized shower-stall--we're on cocksleeve. Help her up with me GAME IF YOU DON'T LET ME SO HELP ME ON ALL THE ROCKS AND DREAMS I JUST WILL ANYWAY--it lets me squat and hold my hand out.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I also remember this from my sick friend: she probably won't take our help, and that's okay.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Squat beside Cherry and hold hands out.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Magic. Want a hand?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She looks at me, then stares at Boobsong.</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"Fffuck, I guess that's it fer Jesus then. Fuck that rat bastard fer this. I'm on yer side, see? Do I gotta sell my soul 'r can we just be buddies in cryin' about what a jerk the father son and holy asshole is? What's it mean if I take her hand, bindin' contract shake on it?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"It means she helps you up. I'm not the devil, so I don't do deals."</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"Yer with Jesus after all? Temptation, 's that why th' sexy demon bein' all helpful?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"We&nbsp;<i>are</i>&nbsp;on your side, but the sides are humanity against the piece of shit that did this to you, not God versus Satan. Jesus is alright with me, you can call him if you want,&nbsp;it's really up to you."</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"Yer tellin' me that you an yer demon girlfriend would be&nbsp;<i>completely fine</i>&nbsp;if I was t' call&nbsp;<i>Jesus come an' save</i>&nbsp;<i>me</i>, not that he'd actually save my sorry ass anyways? Not that I want 'im to. Look at me now. You know how I got fucked up this way? Missions work in Uganda. Shot my pretty legs t' pieces. There's believin' on th' name o' Jesus Christ for ya. Fuckin'&nbsp;<i>god's plan</i>, here we are!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She coughs, then takes Boobsong's hand.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Rrraaah pull Cherry up! Gasp you smell so painful Cherry please Princess you have to help her!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That's the plan.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Yes, we'd be fine. Where's comfortable? Will you talk to us a little?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"Ain't much but my couch's okay. Through that way. Lemme get my crutches--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Hang on. Boobsong, slice her off an earring."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I look at Cherry.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Can you trust me? Chew it up and swallow. Don't bother with the gum part. It's fun but you have bigger things to think about."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Hand up to earlobe shing sliceOUCH grab the falling gum hold it out to Cherry very sweetly.</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"The fuck's I've got to lose?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She grabs the gum, palms it into her mouth and just swallows it like a giant pill--</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"Shit, what'd you give to me!? I feel it movin' through me like I'm water! Fallin' straight down like--no you've got t' be kiddin' me. Don't fuck with my head like this, it ain't kind--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Just keep cutting her more when she asks for it, cocksleeve.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"If I ever fuck with your head, you'll be laughing, not thinking I really must be the devil. You can have as much as you want here and now but I'm trying to get you set up with your own supply and you're going to feel romantic about it so take that into account. Hang onto your ass now, because sometimes it--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"What the shit!? How is it&nbsp;<i>hair dye?"</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Cherry picks up a lock of turning-red hair, then lets go of Boobsong's hand and goes to reach for the sink to flop over to look in the mirror and just stops, staring at nothing, hands in the air.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh. <i>This </i>was what kept us going through all that stuff we did. I don't know if I'll explode crying or laughing.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Come on, try a step! Her hands go out, but she doesn't grab onto anything. She bounces, just a little, slowly, in place, then pulls her foot back, spins gracefully in place and ends low in a sort of bow and stays there and looks up, face intense, breathing hard. Her hair is completely bright red already.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"COOL!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She's crying, but doesn't sob or make noise, tears just run down, and I can feel the sympathetic sob building.<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"How long. How long's a dose go for."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Um...I mean, I&nbsp;<i>think</i>&nbsp;forever, but I haven't really managed not to have any for more than like ten minutes at a time--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"Yer&nbsp;<i>shitting</i>&nbsp;me. What&nbsp;<i>is</i>&nbsp;this stuff? Why's yer girlfriend wear&nbsp;<i>earrings&nbsp;</i>out of it? I'd keep this shit in fort knox!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Feel like a walk? We can tell you everything,&nbsp;<i>hopefully</i>. We're from the future and time travel can be REALLY LAME--" I shout this upwards at the world in general "--sometimes when you're trying to fix the past, but if we could give you that and have it fix your legs and hair I'm sure we can walk around your neighborhood. Come on, it'll be fun, you can enjoy the looks on people's faces."</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"Yer in th' middle o' Chicago--the fuck are you sayin' Marlene, they could give a fuck! Alright, lemme put some real clothes on--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Um, depending on how you feel about your breasts, you might wanna either wait on the next piece of gum or skip the bra."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I thought it was funny, but she just looks serious. Her stance has to be tiring, but I think that's the point.</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"Y'ain't serious. The fuck else does it do, give blowjobs? Paint my nails for me?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Look at your hands."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Slowly, she puts her fingers up, with her arms still out, and looks at them. Her nails are bright cherry red, matching her hair, as perfectly manicured as my own fingerbang-toys.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"It doesn't give blowjobs but I did totally cum from having a lot of it at one point."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Cherry hops from one foot to the other, staying in her low poise.</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"That's possibly the weirdest side-effect I ever heard of, and I've seen some. I'm serious, the fuck is this stuff?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Succubus nectar. It's how they make sure their lunch is always ready. Come on, don't you wanna go individually jump up and down on every sidewalk crack that ever tripped you off your crutches?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Cherry pops up from her crouch, dances in place a bit with her arms up, and the fire alarm goes off.</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"That's the third time this evenin'! Y'all ever climb stairs on crutches? Twice already an--I...I ain't gotta. I ain't gotta climb on crutches."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She's stopped with her arms still up, mid-dance, looking like she totally doesn't know how to process the emotions.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Race you to the bottom!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"Y'all know yer on the fifth floor an no elevator, right?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Better hurry before we use our time-travel magic to cheat, then!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She just looks at us for a moment, then bolts. I grab Boobsong's hand and charge after her and we rush around two corners and almost catch up to Cherry as she slips shoes on then out her front door and into the hallway and in no time we're in the stairwell, following Cherry as she leaps over the railings to jump down whole flights at a time.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">RAAAH CHARGE! Follow Princess down Cherry BOOM down each flight hehe that's a metal way to climbs stairs!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Down the stairs, out the front door, and into the street from the journey before. It's night, and we pile out into the yellowy shine of a Chicago streetlight. Cherry bounces on her heels and instantly sets off down the block, ignoring the cold, and we follow and catch up. She moves so Boobsong will be between us as we walk abreast and I let her. Down the sidewalk, a pack of guys in matchingly-humongous poofy jackets and stop and stare. I raise my free hand, smile, wave, and then hold my hand out lazily and melt the sidewalk between us to red-glowing magma with a microwave laser dressed up with a nice eye-safe every-wavelength visible beam to show them where it's coming from.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">It's kind of fun. Going down into radio feels a little like singing in boy-falsetto, scratchy-rumbly.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"You guys look so cold! Warm up by it!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I chirp it out as annoying-cute as I can, and then bend us off across the empty street before anyone can react. My last glimpse of them shows their leader dutifully holding his hands out over the red-hot concrete like a fire.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Wait, where's Cherry? She's standing, staring at the guys and the melted sidewalk, but runs to catch up.</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"Are you SHITTING me? Gangbangers at twelve o'clock no problem just MELT THE DAMN SIDEWALK! You came out specificially t' show off, didn't you? Don't play cool, I konw a showoff, I&nbsp;<i>was</i>&nbsp;one until--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"You mean you&nbsp;<i>are&nbsp;</i>one?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">She just looks teary for a moment.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"So where do you want to start--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"Yer girlfriend here, she have any single brothers?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The vacant lot across the road is a sadly closed and no-tresspassinged Christmas tree lot, and the street looks dreary up ahead. It'll be cold at the lakeshore, but much nicer.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"The answer to that is&nbsp;<i>how many were you thinking of,&nbsp;</i>but before you process that, would you rather have a nice quiet flight, or see how much of the airforce we can fight off before it gets boring?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"How is it possible t' be so accidentally terrifyin' on purpose? OF COURSE I WANT A QUIET FLIGHT! Y'all got an airplane down yer cleavage, right?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Not&nbsp;<i>my&nbsp;</i>cleavage, but yeah.&nbsp;Boobsong, ponify, but scale up for the two of us if you need to to fly."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Ghhaaaaaah change whee pushing into you both sorry Cherry hehe you like it that's so fun! Doof four hooves ready waiting pony shape.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Are you really sure? Her dragon form is totally fucking metal, it just kind of grabs attention."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Cherry just stands and gapes. Don't kneel, cocksleeve. Let her jump.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">As for me, I flumph my wings out at full glow, and flap onto Boobsong's back, then put them away again look down at Cherry.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Big spoon or little spoon? I won't grope unless you start it."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Cherry laughs and shakes her head.</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"Y'all 'r somethin' else. What's next, a submarine up yer asshole? Just haul me up already."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I hold a hand down, she takes it, crouches and jumps neatly across Boobsong's back with almost no help from me. I put an arm around her middle to steady her (she very carefully neither snuggles nor anti-snuggles), grab Boobsong's mane with the other hand, and kick. Yah!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Raise wings high super pretty batpegasus very metal check it out Cherry rraaaaah FLAP high up with one jump!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Nice. Now find us a nice romantic beach while we figure out how to&nbsp;<i>actually&nbsp;</i>get her.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Flap some more up nice and high above Chicago that's a nice view let's go that way!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The city stretches out in front of us, glowing cyberpunky-grid in the night. It's no Disney at dusk, but--Acme Station, how good actually is your transport stuff? Could you jump us to Disney without dropping Cherry?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes your Acme Station can conflation-jump magic romantic flying through the city-night, Princess, but then she can't get Cherry home again!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay. I'm sure a lot of their stuff is electromechanical still. Can you do Culture-style EM effectors?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Can your Acme Station simply just manipulate magnetic fields super far away very detailedly? Of course she can Princess what do you think of her!? Do you want her to directly leave a thank you note right on Disney's hard drive without his computer being on?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">HAH! Yes. Get ready. You'll know when--and don't worry, she'll have her own ride back. If she&nbsp;<i>comes&nbsp;</i>back.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"It's funny you should mention that about submarines, actually, because Boobsong here and me have a kid who turns into one, and she--anyway. What's your favorite Disney ride?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"Ain't that a bit of a hike even by pegasus?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO"><b>PRAH!</b></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Chicago's sodium-vapor grid snaps into the front gate of Cinderella's castle, and we're at Disneyland.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Not really."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Cherry's just quiet again for a minute and I hope I haven't messed up. She's definitely become hard rock with her hard life, but I'm counting on the innocence of that bouncy little girl on the stage in her fantasy still being sitting in the corner of her heart crying and wishing it could just do something like run around Disneyland for a day.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Or night.</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"I--y'all--fuckin'--I ain't never been! Now yer takin' me at three in the mornin', ain't this whole place closed now?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Bring the lights up, Boobsong."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Park lights everywhere hi wake up Princess called for you!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Around us, the dim of closed Disneyland turns into the Magic Kingdom After Hours.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Now let's just land and get that walk in. I'm sure we'll see something that catches your eye. Take us inside, cocksleeve."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Gently fly to the castle gate and land right on the drawbridge.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Boobsong lands with a soft clop, and I hop off, and Cherry handstands her way off to land beside me. Girlify, cocksleeve, and get snuggly, and help me find what's metal enough here to make Cherry implant.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">AaaaAAAAAAHH small again. Snuggle up to Princess very super close and cuddly. Watching out for super very metal things. Princess that's a lot of stuff but maybe Cherry needs some comfort too. Her life is very hard so far, so what if we walk along the moat here?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Good idea.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Come on! This is pretty."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I set us walking along the water's edge with the castle on our left, Boobsong between us again.</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"Now whaddaya mean&nbsp;<i>how many</i>? Yer serious again, aren'tcha."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Yes, totally. Her kind are called su'khora, which is where the Latin word&nbsp;<i>succubus&nbsp;</i>comes from. It's a long story. They don't drain your spirit or take lifeforce or anything, just grow from the shine your heart puts out when they make it shine the way trees grown on sunlight. They start as seeds that grow into somebody like Boobsong here, shaped by the desires of the person who planted them, so you don't have to just get Boobsong's brothers as they are, you'll get however many is right for you just the way that's right for you which yes can mean boys. Boobsong looks this way because I'm a huge lesbian. Fair warning, though, it's a two way street. It changes you."</p>
<p data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">"Fuck if I care. If I can get what you've got I'll be a giant frog. That's why ya said I'd be romantic about it, yer sayin' I can get something from mine like you just gave me, right? Get me seeds, ya made the sale! What's it like t' grow one?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"You end up with somebody like Boobsong here, with powers that'll make you horny, and like, watch out, because it's completely ruthless. I like radio control toys, and, well, show her your tail, cocksleeve--I'm not still selling you. You'll understand in a second."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Tail up show to Cherry put controls out.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Cherry looks at her tail incredulously, but I keep talking.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Cute, right? I'm showing you how weird they can be to get your wishing going. The way this works is, you see one, or an image or story or something one of them made with their human, and deep down in your heart you feel how much you want&nbsp;<i>your&nbsp;</i>version of that, you want what they have. That's why I'm showing off so bad, we're trying to make you envious enough to get there. You feel it, and your heart reaches out for it, imagines what it'd be like if that your-version was real for you, it's like...people always talk about porn objectifying women, right? Go the other way, look at us like porn but then de-objectify us into the people we'd have to be to actually be what you want to believe you're looking at. Feel what it'd feel like for your fantasy lover to be a real person--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">It's working Princess just keep going!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm just talking! We haven't done anything yet!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"--but here's the thing. Do you get why we flew your sweary heavy-metal ass to&nbsp;<i>Disneyworld?&nbsp;</i>Why I showed you Boobsong's tail just now? Somewhere inside of you there's a kid who's been crying she'd never jump around on a stage the whole time you've been on those crutches and probably all kinds of other stuff you just want because you do and it doesn't make sense and it isn't&nbsp;<i>justifiable</i>&nbsp;and you don't dare even think most of it, and that's the you who makes the wish that makes this happen. You don't have to go in there and fix it all up so they can tell you every last thing they want or list it all out in some kind of vision board thing, but you&nbsp;<i>do&nbsp;</i>have to just for the one moment it'll take them to make the wish give them enough compassion to say yeah, okay, it&nbsp;<i>would</i>&nbsp;be cool to have a girlfriend you can drive around on her hands and knees like a remote controlled car by her tail because oh by the way she's demon--they don't have to look like that, I just think demons are metal. So just, give that kid enough breathing room to want what they want, just for a moment. You seem strong to me, probably all you have to do is stop kicking your own ass long enough and you'll be all over this. Just for a moment, and then hang onto your tits, if you've still got a free hand, that is."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">OOOH all that evangelical stuff in her video she's bitter because she<i>&nbsp;liked </i>all that what she needs is just a good off-the-cuff sermon!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess very close now just something to unstick her!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Oh and don't freak out about the responsibility. You're planting a seed, not playing Frankenstien. It knows how to grow right. Just give it light and, heh,&nbsp;<i>water,&nbsp;</i>and it'll go good. There's no real way to screw this up, the magic they're made of is light-years beyond any puny ability you might have to mess up anything in your life--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Seeds keep going Princess just keep saying she can do it!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"This isn't like taking on a kid or getting pregnant. You'll be fine taking care of them. Yours might even take care of you! I know one girl who's pretty much literally a pet to hers, and like, Boobsong here is my handmaiden, and that's just somebody who takes care of a Princess, except, you know, exactly to order."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">RAAAAH SEEDS COME&nbsp;<b>ON</b>&nbsp;LIKE ALMOST CUMMING NOT QUITE KEEP GOING!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Sades sweet sugarballs it's just like that--OOOOOH.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Now one more thing. Do you think you're a good person? Do you care? Doesn't matter. They will&nbsp;<i>make&nbsp;</i>you good. Even if yours is as submissive as obedient little Boobsong here, I can't even begin to explain how much of a choice you won't have in that, and how much it will&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>look like what your great aunt or whoever put you up to all that mission stuff thinks of as&nbsp;<i>good</i>. Especially it won't make your relationship any less metal. Boobsong what would you say the kinkiest, most metal thing we've done just since the raft is? Not counting Mama dying and coming back, that one's cheating."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"That's so many things though! Umm...Princess your cocksleeve thinks the scene where you burned the clothes off that whole army was super very metal and also very kinky since you made your infrared laser tail dragon do it for you, and she had to be super very careful not to burn the people, and that was hard work that she could do for you, which is kinky for your cocksleeve because it makes her very horny to work so hard to please you."</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">HERE WE GO SEEDS COMING OUT TO CHERRY HAAAH EEEYUS WE GOT HER!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Congratulations, cocksleeve!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The journey breaks and the Dreams show us another post-it sticking out the pages of my book--you know what to do handmaiden.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Reach down take book find post-it shiny sparkles red hehe show book to Princess.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">In the comfy dim lighting of the Whaleship the post-it looks kind of like a firework sparkling and has little bouncy springs with glitter-pompoms sticking off it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"America isn't the only reason fireworks happen. Have a Soefta'xrnian cupcake and try some Crepish pudding, because it's Revelry!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I start reading--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Lying back against the big poofy chair-cushion on the blanket with Boobsong in my lap as the fireworks zoom up and burst to fill the sky is so magical I want to cry except I'm too busy goin <i>"oooh" </i>at the green trails that climb slowly up and explode with a big satisfying <i>bang </i>into giant red flowers--</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">GASP It's working!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Yeah!"&nbsp;</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I squeal with glee as explosions erupt from the empty stage in front of us and fireworks shoot from nowhere in a crossfire that fills it with smoke and spiralling rocket-trails and sparks and then somehow the stage has the frame of lights and speakers it was missing and three figures are stepping out of the mist, two totally ripped boys with triangular guitars and a girl with bright red hair and a silhoutte almost as epic as mine and Revelry is here! Behind them, in the smoke, a grin appears as big and wicked as the Cheshire cat, light-beams shine out from behind a huge glittery-silver drumkit, and drumsticks held high emerge from the smoke followed by the shining silver of Boobsong's horns and then the rest of her waiting poised as the Twins start the intro to <i>Shine.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This part's kind of weird, because that's <i>us </i>up there, but not us now, us from the future, after we find the Revelry Bard--nobody knows who she is or where she's from, she's just the Revelry Bard and she and her band which also includes the Sugarfeast Fairy and Openveil Spectre and Heartwarming Cook will play an empty stage on Revelry if you call out to them with red sparkly things and food from all over the multiverse in one place and a real big party if you can make one happen.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">With a gleefully melodramatic crash and a face that's having more fun than Earth's had in its whole history Boobsong slams the drumsticks down and stomps on the bass to start the beat, and the Revelry Bard starts singing:</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">When I first</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">felt light it hurt</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">the kinda sight that might erase</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">my strict attendance to the way</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">undo my soul's grace</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">make me lose sight'a God's face</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">The truth is in,</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">The proof is when you hear your heart start asking</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">What good is Heaven?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That summoning is why Boobsong and me are in handmaidens mode on a blanket on a hillside looking down at a huge empty stage&nbsp;with thousands of people around us&nbsp;(they'll&nbsp;<i>play&nbsp;</i>the top of a cereal box if that's what you have to call out with, but why shoot where you could use grenades?)&nbsp;and pizza and french fries and korv all half-eaten on the blanket here--Revelry is also the time when everyone is just <i>people </i>so we're making ourselves just look like part of the crowd to be part of that.</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">And try as you may</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">There is no way</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">to restrain the kinda change</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">of coming into shape as new and</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">growing Sade who like the way the Monsters wave</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">so find your place beneath the waves and fill with light</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The smoke behind Boobsong clears to reveal my legs in rainbow stockings dangling because I'm flying, then there's a brilliant flash and Santa Claus the Heartwarming Cook's sleigh Deloreans in raining party favors as she swoops back and forth over the crowd. It's all the stuff you need to have good times at a concert in the night-time: silly hats and foam fingers to wave with and glow sticks and necklaces and rings and things and water bottles on parachutes so they don't bonk you and boxes of candy made of nectar to keep you dancing and heal you and probably all sorts of stuff--come on, dancer, let's get down there! Grab glow-stuff, if I can't use my light I'm going to be shiny <i>somehow!</i></p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">Shine.</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">Make 'em wonder whatcha got.</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">Make 'em wish that they were not</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">On the outside looking bored.</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">Shine.</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">Let it shine before all them</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">Let em see your face and then</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">Let it scare 'em even more.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Poing up and help you up here glow things hey a crown perfect! Grab running down the hill with you!</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">Only the way the light can make</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">the darkest feats the cruelst beats</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">warm your soul with love like a tend'r kiss</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">fill your heart like teenager's dreams of true kind affection</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">Oprah freaks</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">And science seeks</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">A rationale that shall excuse this strange behavior</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The smoke is clear enough now to see the bass drum, which has swoopy-squishy text on it: <i>Freeride. </i>As we charge down the hillside with everyone else the smoke pulls back to reveal me onstage in rainbow-glitter pasties and a matching g-string being a one-fairy light-show to go along with the music.</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">When you let it Shine</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">You will inspire all the way from Earth to Rl'yeh Sade</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">to make the leap they dared not take</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">Monsters who don't yet know the way</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A huge shape zooms up from nowhere overhead stretching into place like taffy in fast-forward, and transporter beams light up the hillside as we run: the Openveil Witch who's the reason for the whole ferry over the river of death myth is here, and tonight her ferry is a Galaxy-class starship bringing thousands of guests from the otherworld, projecting here by "beaming" down to party with us. They're all different shapes and sizes, as weird and wonderful as Shine's lyrics attest for Rl'yeh Sade, and it makes me want to unfold my wings and get Boobsong's demon-girl out. I only don't because then we'd be <i>recognizable</i>.</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">But out of the glare<br></p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">The Deep Ones will learn</p>
<p class="Cherry" data-voice-id="Cl0LIKkVq">How to find their light inside</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I blink and we're back on the whaleship with Boobsong holding the book for me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"That was the <i>coolest--"</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">--doing the hold-hands-and-spin thing with Boobsong, there's a crowd around us and the world flashes light and dark as we spin. She's laughing and grinning as we spin dizzy fast, I pull her in and we whirl on my heel like ice-skaters and just stare at her until we stop, then turn to look up at Cherry onstage with the Washington Monument lit up behind it, she has the mic to her mouth and is waving in rhythm to the music--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Before either of us can move, the next briefing screen is up. Book down, handmaiden!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Put book down beside me and snuggle tight here we go!</p>
