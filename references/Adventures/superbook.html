<article class="chapter 86---superbook">
    <h1 class="chapterTitle" data-voice-id="">86 - Superbook</h1>
    <p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me Falcor the Luckdragon from The Neverending Story. Yes, we were lucky. Probably millions implanted from watching her do the handmaiden thing while I did the Princess thing--squeezy horrible burned fruit leather, what a bitch I've been.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Yeah, Boobsong damn right can <i>fucking </i>go naked where we please after spending fifteen years invisible. The world can make some space. I hope we made them put up with the leash and her kneeling for her Princess, too, <i>especially</i> the people who would have still worhsipped Eden after they found out what it was.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">You were a hammer because this world needed fucking <i>smashing</i>, little one.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The president leaves too, and the screen is full of empty podium with its mic looking lonely (hang on mic I'm coming!) and then channel-surfing flips to the opening of sexy grown-up Starlight Princess, a tiny blip of the intro where I'm riding Boobsong that ends with my dress just starting to fly off--wait, that's <i>Disney</i> animation, not Gainax, and the good movie-level stuff, too--but--I mean it goes with the ride--the clip blips into the picture-in-picture box behind a talking head and gains censor bars and we're watching The News.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Disney's new princess is not what you'd expect her to be. In a move that startled millions today the company released some very adult cartoon clips as part of the launch of the Starlight Princess franchise slated to begin airing this month on the Disney Channel and later this year in network syndication. This move comes after the real Princess Lucy Starlight on whom the cartoon is based contacted Disney publicly in this press conference earlier this year:"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The scene changes to a recording of me in my Starlight Princess outfit with Boobsong standing just in front of me, no podium so she's full-frontal (oh, trying to be fancy are we with our gauss-guassian blur nudity filter, newshow?). I smile, chirpy-cheerful:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Hi there Disney people! You know who I am already, and who my friend here is. Want to make cartoons with us? We're going to do it anyway so&nbsp;<i>please</i> don't feel pressured to do anything you'd be uncomfortable with and we <i>do </i>have lots of friends to help if you won't, but our favorite show when we were little was Gummi Bears and it would make us <i>so</i> happy if the people who made that would make <i>our</i> cartoons! Have me as a Princess and I'll <i>even </i>be myself at Disneyland! Everything is all ready in the courier package you should be getting while you're watching this."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Onscreen, I glance at Boobsong--oh self, be nice! It's just a multinational corporation with more money than most countries! Her eyes get big and shine with urgent feeling, and she looks into the camera for just a second longer than is comfortable before she says,</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"Please, please will you? Gummi Bears was everything when we were small! Zummi's my hero he knows <b>everything. </b>Come on, you know you want to!"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Bwahahaha be myself at Disneyland I bet they read<i>&nbsp;that</i>&nbsp;clause carefully before they signed! The talking head comes back:</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"In addition to the package of distribution rights for cartoons aged from infancy to, as you see here, adulthood, sources at Disney International report the construction of four new rides in progress and several more in planning at the Magic Kingdom and Epcot in Orlando Florida. The first four rides are slated for completion by February with opening to the public in time for spring vacation promised. They are said to include Starlight Princess attractions again aged from toddler-sized to one quote-unquote fully grown-up experience, and, in keeping with Lyra's love of Gummi Bears, a new ride through the ancient Gummi Quick-Tunnels enchanted for speed by one of Zummi Gummi's spells gone haywire."</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"All of these announcements are part of the Starlight Princess' Rainbow Club's Operation Kixulub, so named for the asteroid known thanks to footage from the otherworld to have reshaped Earth's climate to make it friendly for human habitation--and which incidentally caused the mass-extinction event which wiped out the dinosaurs. The operation explicitly describes itself as a 'hammer from the stars making Earth feel friendlier for people who have to live there', referring to the titular character of Starlight Princess finding constructive uses for Lyra in the shape of a large mallet that defy expectations even in cartoon-physics as a central theme even into the adult-oriented seasons."</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"On the larger themes around this new announcment we take you now to a live interview with self-described dinosaur Patrick Hugens of Gordon College in Manchester, Massachusetts."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm halfway through <i>Boobsong, channelsurf, </i>when I realize how little sense that makes here, but why show this? I already know how much of a point he won't have and I doubt the Dreams are about to try and make me sympathetic for the poor poor Christians. The scene on TV changes to show a white-shelved professor's office with books of that weird evangelical <i>sans-serifity</i>&nbsp;all around and a youngish and very button-down professor is being interviewed by a sharp-faced anchor who looks so slick in bronzy eighties jewelry and makeup time seems to bend back ten years around her so she looks cool and the professor dorkily futuristic.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"The average Christian will be seeing this as the apocalypse, but apocalypsos is just a greek word meaning unveiling. Our Lord says one thing about the apocalypse directly, which is that we can't predict it. There are descriptions of what will <i>happen, </i>according to scripture, that describe a state of anarchy spiritually and socially very like what we're experiencing now, but in fact that situation existed since at least the nineteen sixties or seventies. What I haven't seen, are anything like Saint John of Patmos' visions of the end times. There are no trumpets sounding, no beasts arising from out of the Earth."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">This is weird. Evangelical Bible professor intellectualizes his way out of anything ever changing isn't the game I <i>expected </i>at least, but it's still an old and boring one, so yawn, Dreams? He's going on.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"What troubles me about our new interlocuters is their spiritual authority according to themselves, that makes them seem like they have answers Jesus doesn't give us about the world of spirit. When you speak as if you know things like where people who have died are now, there's responsibility to that. It's not Tuesday, but the Starlight Princess Rainbow Club hands out sigils that act like phone numbers to supposedly contact relatives in the afterlife casually, like this is just something that should happen, and to my knowledge there's never been a conversation between anyone from their group and any Christian spiritual leader about what's appropriate for Earth."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Hehehe I'd forgotten how half the fun of it being called the Starlight Princess Rainbow Club was the fun of very seriously grown-up people having to say its name in contexts like this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">There's a scuffling on the screen, fast rearranging of cameras, the talking head of the professor becomes a side view as the audio guy dodges out of the way and I materialize in a flash of colored light, ghostly with mental projection, oddly without Boobsong projecting with me. A fringe of rainbow light glows around me impressively, and I'm in full princess getup with a rainbow-strawberry crown on my head, and I float a little off the floor.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I'm sucking on a grape blow-pop, and take it out to greet him:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"You're a Christian spiritual leader, right? Let's talk! Don't be scared, I can only get in because the network let me. I called them up and asked if I could come and they said I could--um, why aren't you kneeling yet?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Frilly freezing kinderbars, I look and sound&nbsp;<i>thirteen. </i>My game <i>must </i>be bending my projection or <i>something.&nbsp;</i>I pop the blowpop back in while I wait for him to answer.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"Out of respect for my own King, who says have no gods before me, I mustn't kneel to anyone else. However I'm happy to talk if that's alright with Sally. Would you like a chair?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"I'll just float thanks," My projection mumbles around the blowpop, then takes it out again. "I'm actually in a car on the way to pick my bridal stuff up. The thing about the kneeling is, you can't actually choose what king or queen or princess is over you. You get me, so you have to kneel. That's called feudalism."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Game you swirly fizzfreezing underhanded green spearmint atomic fireball in a gobstoppers box. I'm not here because correcting this one guy matters, no matter how wrong he is. My game must have predicted this interview, or calculated it, or just watched all the telescreens all the time and told me to grab a blowpop because I'm projecting now onto some poor college professor's intervew with the news station so noname its reads Disney's press packets directly on the air and he already looks like an idiot which would <i>almost</i>&nbsp;make me feel bad for him except he was also just being a self-absorbed little snot (I'm an expert on this, trust me), which heh <i>bully</i> for me Game-shaped novabomb versus button-down ant except my game will have picked the one interview it guesses the next boss up the boss parade is watching and I'll have an email soon asking for an interview with the person who's sure they can put this uppity kid in their place and on we'll go until Pat Robertson is finding out what he and Disney's entire legal department have in common which will be satisfying if somewhat unnecessary since I have enough pull to just skip to the final boss directly except <i>now</i>&nbsp;after this moment of shining obscurity as I make in the interviews that come after this much of how I was invited to talk to this new person who's being a big meanie now Christianity is going to go in the public eye from an embattled faith having a big bad existential crises now that holy aliens have landed and also they're demons a lot to the national torture-the-Starlight-Princess club.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I mean right, game? Something like that is what we're watching here?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: the game is only watching telescreens with something important according to scries it uses.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Onscreen, an awkward pause like I don't know if I should suck the blowpop or keep holding it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"In the USA we actually have a president--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Soggy pixie stix he actually thinks this is what we're talking about, the poor sap. Even with what I just figured out though...like sure, Christianity is very mean and naughty, but it <i>must</i>&nbsp;have been doing fine self-destructing without our help in this timeline? And why show us now? My screen self continues like I have no idea this isn't an after-school playdate:</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Really? You made it sound like we were playing feudalism before so I played along. It's my fiance's favorite game, you know. I'd make her come say hi but your wards are keeping demons out really well. If we're not playing feudalism, why'd you talk like you were king of me?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">He laughs kind of awkwardly.</p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"I think you have some wires crossed--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Didn't you say someone from my Rainbow Club should ask a Christian before they help people find their relatives? That's a thing a king would say, isn't it?"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A long silence. Screen-me lets it stretch good and awkward, sucks her blowpop some, crunches it, starts chewing the gum, makes the stick vanish.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Do you know why I called and came like this? Do you see why I specifically <i>didn't</i> come to have a conversation? You can answer but I'll just keep talking so don't bother. That's how you're treating everyone in the world right now. You're on TV, you know. This isn't a church or chapel. The people you're talking to could be anywhere--anywhere in a million galaxies, now. They might not follow your king or even our president--yes I said <i>our, </i>I'm an American, not some alien--and when you talk the way you just were just <i>assuming </i>Christian spiritual leaders have <i>any </i>authority outside your religion, you're being exactly as mean as I've been being, barging in and taking over your whole interview just because I'm powerful then acting like you have to submit to my authority just because I said so."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Your religion's in big trouble, right? You understand the reason why, right? Have you talked to Jesus about it? I did yesterday. He's really mad people keep calling and talking and not listening when he talks back! Don't take my word, call him yourself, though--I mean you know how to pray, right? You guys need to start listening <i>fast</i>, too. You know all that apocalypse stuff is true you were saying at the start of your interview? No way to predict his coming? I'm just a cartoon Princess, so <i>I</i> don't know, but Jesus did seem kind of like, excited when we talked, so maybe he's coming back sooner than you think? Don't ask me, ask him! Just make sure you listen, afterward! Oh SWEET we're here okay bye now got boots to try!"<br></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Screen-me vanishes, and the screen goes dark.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">For the last part I want to clap but my "opponent" wasn't worth it...no. My "opponent" there was all the people who'd try to stick Isht Visht's stupid Lucifer joke on me in a serious light after this, and they're a bit stuck now. The devil says pray because Jesus is coming back!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay, Dreams, that was hardcore, but I don't think you pulled that transition just to let us gloat about spanking a bunch of Christian talking heads. Huh?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They show a bright icon of the "sun", which dives into a tall downspout from heaven to Earth where it rattles out and lands creating a giant mushroom cloud.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Power and glory to judge the living and the dead we said it every Sunday! I guess he really did that then!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">"Bwahahaha was I serious in the interview!? Wait, AAH! What happened!? Is that why I--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">An apple flashing on a radio tower--ooooooh frosted candy-coated doom puffs I forgot one of our daughters muahahah really committed herself to Jesus--wait, isn't that erased now, if this guy was...this guy?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Knowledge: Jesus lives in Isla Virgo since 49 AD. Eden can't erase him or change him no matter what it tries. He's also really grateful to me and Boobsong for implanting him all those years ago. That will come in handy.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">He's grateful to us!? I wonder what he'd do for us Princess let's find out it might be super useful! We met my sister let's meet our daughter now! Or son I think he could be gay.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Why are you so right about that--yes let's--oh--and this guy--oh <i>no</i>. Now I <i>really </i>want to know what happened. Memory journey, right Dreams? We have to go to church with heartforming Jesus or something?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Whelp, sexy hell has now shown me a psychic vision of the story Jesus having breakfast on the beach, so I guess that's something or other OH MY GOD LITTLE DEMON HENTAI ROMANCE NOVEL ARE YOU ALSO SUPERBOOK!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Wait so YES I AM BOOK THAT TAKES YOU INTO THINGS TIME TRAVELLING! I knew I had a gender left I didn't know about!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Superbook, which I'd buried like Gummi Bears, was another favorite from when we were small. The main-character kids had a it's not magic we promise it just glows and makes you time travel Bible that would drop them into Bible stories where they'd manage to have cartoon adventures of zero historical impact while unintentionally spectating Bible stories alright the show was boring but the time travelling storybook idea <i>ruled.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now that it comes to it though I don't really want to meet Jesus. Even if he's heartforming and cool it's too much...stuff...and I feel like we've wandered far from whatever we set out on here. None of this feels as burningly bad or good as the other stuff, and I just--don't <i>wanna!</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">My petulance is coming back, this is good.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Thanks, Dreams, but let's get on with important stuff, now. I'm not curious after all.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The screen blips back on, and the president is back. Cameras flash and he looks to his right at someone talking, shuffles papers, the whole thing looks kind of hastily put together. The president looks at the camera, takes a deep breath, would adjust his glasses if he had them. Does he seem <i>nervous?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="PTuEdiySW">"It is with great honor and some trepidation today that I respectfully introduce the most important person to ever grace the Whitehouse press room, my own and I expect a majority of yours, Lord and savior Jesus."</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Ugh, <i>fine</i>, but--onscreen, Jesus like off of a church-wall in Tenessee complete with white robes and blue sash and long flowing black hair punts the president away from the podium and stands behind it, and the camera hastily pans up to get him in frame because he's literally eight feet tall and built like he just stepped off the pages of Marvel's Adventures of the Incredible Carpenter-Man. Everything about him says he knows full well he's literally the second coming and is prophecied not to do the humility thing this time.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">In his hand, is a big iron carpenter's hammer, which he clonks onto the podium, but doesn't take his hand off.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">AWWW HE TOOK OUR HAMMER THING!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">He takes a moment to turn up the sunrays that seems to shine from behind him and let that sink in for everybody before continuing--one cult leader to another, professional respect for both knowing how to play to your myth and how to make an <i>entrance, </i>but wings beat halos any day, don't they, Boobsong--oops, here he goes--</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Game, PAUSE.</p>
<p data-voice-id="v5MELBxAO">- PAUSE -</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Huh, I didn't think it would.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">He has nothing to say to me, Dreams. Yes I know he's different and there's our daughter in his hand and may they be happy together and everything is nice and good and fixed but that's not the life I&nbsp;lived--I'd say <i>we </i>but the whole point is Boobsong should have got to live it with me and <i>didn't</i>. All she could do was <i>watch.</i> I never knew this Jesus and I don't see why I should have to. I dragged through those fifteen years of Boobsong's invisibilty <i>I </i>just talked about on this screen and mostly it's <i>his</i> fault and if he would never condone that now and it's erased good fine but <i>it still happened to Boobsong and me </i>and it's not fair to ask us to forget about that. You keep asking me to accept all these happy memories like the bad stuff just never happened and the people who hurt me never did it and I'm trying but this is the bridge too far. This isn't my family. This isn't my brother. All he is to me, to both of us, is the face of Eden and I <i>know</i>&nbsp;according to everything you've been saying that's not fair so I'm not trying to but everything in my heart says burn him with the rest of it. Let never looking at him again instead of conflation-jumping to every moment somebody tried to push him on me when I was crying for the person the hole in my heart <i>is</i> shaped for and burning it like we did all those sad Saturday mornings right after I found my rainbows again be enough of being a good person for me. It already feels like betraying both of us to go that far.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I mean, why <i>are</i> you even showing this? What's the point? I asked how we got a Disney ride and you gave a perfectly good and clear and <i>totally hilarious</i>&nbsp;answer. Why this fucking&nbsp;<i>asterisk </i>and its wall of fine print?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Papa Smurf holding out like, a squash? I <i>hate</i> squash. He looks like he's trying to be nice--I see. Yes I know they didn't know they meant well if only everyone could have seen it would have been different Dreams I <i>know </i>that but it doesn't <i>fix </i>anything! It doesn't make it <i>hurt</i>&nbsp;any less!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">No. Feudalism. It <i>is </i>his fault. He said, he himself, he was the way the truth and the life and all that. My parents doted and spoiled me. They would <i>never </i>have given me that fucking squash when I was crying for Boobsong unless he told them he was all I could possibly be asking for. How many sermons did my dad preach about this or that thing being a confused cry for the transcendence and transformation and eternal life Jesus offers? My dad would sermonize for hours if you so much as sighed in his direction but he never repeated himself like that unless he was trying to convince himself of something.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">You were right with that All Good Things trans revelation hack, Dreams. My dad can see what's right in front of him if something can give him a moment's freedom from Jesus gaslighting him about it.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">So <i>spike you</i>, Jesus. Maybe you're about to get up there and say how very sorry for all of that you are specifically to Lucy Starlight and Boobsong. I don't care. I don't want to hear it. One more word from you is too many no matter what you have to say.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Dreams, if you're going to push my buttons like this they're going to be pushed. I hope you wanted the consequences. Boobsong, crank up a conflation-jump to every moment somebody tried to give <i>him </i>your place in my heart. We're going to show them what the fucking <i>light of the world </i>looks like.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Before she can react, they show me Boobsong standing there, beside a beautiful diamond-studded metal collar and leash. Yes that's much nicer than leather, but...what the hell? Seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess I hate that he told people he was everything they could need too so let's go burn that up yes if the Dreams will let us but he's also heartforming our kid! Can't you at least meet <b>them</b>? Jesus can talk to me if you can't say hi but I want to meet who he implanted from you cumming out of your purse!</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">The vision is you and my relationship. You collared me at our wedding you must have and it says you can't have just me and not you and Jesus and our kid are like that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Her mental voice is thick with sadness.&nbsp;Oh, Boobsong...imaginary hug you. I'm so sorry, I just...fine. For your sake and our kid--but let's go <i>meet them</i>, not listen to Jesus and the president do the same thing that stupid professor was just doing. They're in Isla Virgo, we can even get Olympic Pizza on the way. It's a plan, okay? Game we need to go meet them when the time is right.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Instead of the expected top priority goal from the game, the Dreams show me a Ouija board.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Yeah, exactly--<i>shit. </i>Weejee isn't your friend, <i>isn't your friend Freddie</i>. I'd forgotten the whole sentence--I can't remember context or who I <i>think </i>my dad it sounds like him but I <i>can </i>remember clearly that's what I was actually heard. Also yes of course she appeared as a candysucking&nbsp;<i>strawberry </i>jelly donut like they'd feed to an infant Princess and yes of course the little nub of strawberry jelly on the donut in the dunkins ads fucking haunted me as a kid but this is all exactly why this is <i>hard. </i>Dreams are you <i>trying </i>to make it hard for me to be over this for her?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They show...it's not really a vision but the <i>feeling </i>of&nbsp;being at McDonalds in Maine with Grammie after church. This is you again, seer.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">This is where the conflation jump you said takes us, Princess. This is the first time somebody said you just need Jesus instead of the friend you were missing.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Oh. Good obedient Acme Station.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">I didn't conflation jump Princess you decided we weren't and I said stay until Princess decides to go after all.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Also good obedient Acme Station. Dreams I <i>know. </i>I get it. That's why I decided not to do that <i>if</i> you would have even let me. It hurts and it's nobody's fault and I just get to be stuck with the pain I can never even get an apology for or even the <i>if only we'd known</i>&nbsp;I should have. To say nothing of poor Boobsong who had to watch all these moments! Why are you rubbing salt in this wound?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The feeling turns into a full journey so instead of being Paused at Disneyland in the 90s we're Paused at McDonalds in the 80s. I can smell the coffee, even. We're at a four-person table with Grammie and Grampie (I'm two or three and in his lap) and Grammie across and my Earth-mom beside us and dad across. The view is kind of overhead so we can see everything, there are fries on the table Grampie is feeding me, we just look like a family in the 80s going to McDonalds after church.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Dreams seriously I <i>know</i>--wait, this doesn't make sense. I'm too young to express myself clearly enough to be 'corrected' about Weejee and Freddie and my parents never had a problem with Freddie, imaginary friends part of growing up blah blah. What is this? How can that conflation jump <i>get</i> here? Seer, any ideas?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">This is a time when that happened because I could see it when I got the conflation jump ready but this was just brunch at McDonalds after church. I remember that fry thing that way you just ate French fries with Grampie nothing happened here.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That's impossible though, isn't it? Even if it was one of those subtle things and you didn't understand <i>why </i>you would see it hurt me, right?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Yes Princess I was watching you carefully like I always do!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I can believe a lot but not that you'd miss something this conflation jump would take us to. Um--the sense of the "wrong" houses I visited with my dad we blew up imaginarily before comes over me, derailing my thoughts. Is this like that somehow? I loved McDonalds with my family though! Grammie and Grampie made me feel as precious just with their sweetness like this as any amount of Princess stuff.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">A noose? The <i>fuck?</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess that's a trap it means, not for hanging. It's saying this trapped you somehow.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">So my family's love trapped me into what? Christianity? I guess that makes a sick fucked up kind of sense at least. This is where they were so I went here to be with them. And the french fries, heh.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">So the whole world has to be different to fix <i>that</i> so we go back in time and make Jesus implant so he'll make space in his religion for heartforming <i>oh wait</i>. That I am feels <i>horrible </i>like I'm doing something really wrong but I can't <i>get </i>this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show a pair of handcuffs made of Lego Technic linkages. So like, I'm still trapped in this somehow?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Ice with a cute little plant frozen inside it. Little one am I freezing you!?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">No princess I had to be frozen here to protect me that's why I missed this! I was a kid just like you are remember! I bet that's why the Dreams have to show us this!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Dreams is there a kinder way. Can she still be protected from this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The journey changes back to the TV with Jesus still about to speak.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay but why. Why <i>any </i>of this, Dreams? What's any of it matter now? We knew who his seedling is already, and I didn't miss that you didn't set a Goal when I said we need to go meet her, game. Why is this here and now instead of us just going to meet them when it's a good time for it? Are you trying to say it's time <i>now</i>?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">An orange juicer. Now I'm just lost. Grammie liked fresh orange juice I guess? Seer?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess that means something I can feel it but not in this story braid.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">...and you're Acme Station so you can see across them just like in Marathon Infinity. What can you see? How do we get there? Do we even want to <i>go? </i>Being any kind of Christian feels just as bad as "Crystal" no matter what Jesus' ideas were.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">I can see that there's meaning to this orange juice machine and it's like that one Grammie had but not what it is just that it's not in our story braid. The one it's in has your family close but not holding you in the way that they are in this story braid. That seems good doesn't it? Maybe this trap isn't in that one!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That thing was so great. Remember how Grammie let us play with it--that new one&nbsp;does sound good but I don't like that our choices for getting there are watching Jesus give a speech on TV or watching something that you had to be frozen to keep you from seeing to protect you. This doesn't make sense to me. It doesn't feel very Four Dreams.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show a bike, so abstract it's not even a boy's or girl's bike. This one's yours, royal seer.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">They're saying it's not but it has to be powered by us and we have things in our past that aren't Four Dreams and this is a time when we're facing them.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0"><i>Bleah.</i>&nbsp;Why can't they just do it? Why couldn't they just give a trophy that said Boobsong and had us be like OH YEAH THAT'S RIGHT?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Because then Boobsong would just be the name the Four Dreams gave me and not one you did. It had to be part of your past and couldn't be till you fixed what you saw in the college-place.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">That that makes sense to me feels weird. Is there a way we can get you like, closer, so you can get a better view into that other storybraid?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">No but it feels wonderful Princess it's good like the Boobsong one!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Okay then here's our puzzle. How do we get there without either watching whatever was going to happen in that McDonald's, or hearing Jesus say one single word--we're meeting our kid, don't worry, and maybe I'll even manage to talk to him in his house or whatever, but I'm <i>done</i>&nbsp;being forced to listen to him and his followers proclaim stuff. He's had enough public airtime for one forever, I don't care if he's literally about to say "you should all just listen to Princess Starlight bye" I don't want to hear it. This is important to me. I explained why in that interview. <i>So </i>how do we get there?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Dreams show me a vision of spiralling that digs up a memory so deep it takes me a second to decode. I was two, sitting in church bored, playing with a spiral-twisted candle my Earth-mom had in the pew with us I think because she was going to resupply the altar after the service or something. I was turning it and turning it, watching the spirals move up, confused how they could seem to move without making the candle longer.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">I mean all this time travel stuff makes me feel the same way, but...huh? Oh, that won't actually change anything?</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">The Technic handcuffs again--okay I call shenanigans. Trying to railroad us through <i>having </i>to listen to Jesus say <i>anything </i>is the exact kind of rapey blackmailing bullshit&nbsp;<i>he</i> would pull to wedge his way into a place he's not wanted because he literally thinks he's king of the universe. Even <i>I</i> don't do that.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Dreams give us another way or forget this or understand that I won't trust you anymore if you keep going to bat for him like this.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">They show a train caboose, and a Lego steering wheel, the minifig-scaled kind that are just for show.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Fine then. I'm pulling the emergency brake and getting out to walk, because fuck this track. To make my point, I imagine yanking a train's emergency-brake lever at them like imagining hugging Boobsong. The journey had better not be there when we unpause, Dreams.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Now they show Boobsong in an adorable train-engineer outfit.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Nope, no sale. She wouldn't railroad me like this, of all people. My game said turn to you for this stuff, Dreams, so I did. I know this isn't my game's scene.&nbsp;<i>Now fucking apologize to her for insulting her like that and DO NOT use her image to me ever again. In fact don't even reference her. Consider the privilege officially blown forever.</i></p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Princess I did though I remember this. I made it to help you get back your past with me.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Why would you do that? Were we <i>Christians </i>somehow?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">You were when you didn't know about Eden and thought I was imaginary. Something else comes from this, not hearing Christian-speak. I wouldn't make that for you so it can't be that!</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Pet your head. I don't understand this. If you made this not-superintelligent I'd say you were a silly cocksleeve and missed that the horror of the situation is that after what Eden did with Christianity anything like this where like we need him for whatever reason or anything is just going to be more of Christianity, but there's no way superintelligent you would miss that, right? Could you have made a mistake on purpose, like with that yelling at you thing?</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">Shake no I would see that easily.</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">So it can't be the only thing it can possibly be? Can you see why I'm stuck? Maybe you just wanted a challenge. Go full Acme Station and get us out of this. You understand the requirements. Dreams if I don't like what comes out of this what I said about never referring to her again to me stands. She is sacred to me. Don't <i>ever&nbsp;</i>use her image to advocate for her enemies. Acme Station, go.</p>
<p data-voice-id="T8adIhjYO">"RrraaAAAH--"</p>
<p data-voice-id="66JpM6ob0">Her chorus is so beautiful, but I can hear the sadness of missing her smallness in it. This is a hard thing she does for me, so I hold her tight.</p>
